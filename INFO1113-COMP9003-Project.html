<h2 id="Task-Description"><a href="#Task-Description" class="headerlink" title="Task Description"></a>Task Description</h2><p>In this assignment, you will create a game in the Java programming language using the Processing library<br>for graphics and gradle as a dependency manager. In the game, the player must be able to move chess<br>pieces on a chess board in order to play against an AI, ultimately capturing the opponent’s pieces and<br>executing a strategy to checkmate the opponent’s king.</p>
<p>You have been given the task of developing a prototype of the game. A full description of gameplay<br>mechanics and entities can be found below. An artist has created a simple demonstration of the game<br>and has posted it on your online forum (Ed). You can also play a similar game here.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to ask questions on Ed under the assignments category if you are unsure of the<br>specification – but staff members will not be able to do any coding or debugging in this assignment for<br>you. As with any assignment, make sure that your work is your own, and do not share your code or<br>solutions with other students.</p>
<h2 id="Working-on-your-assignment"><a href="#Working-on-your-assignment" class="headerlink" title="Working on your assignment"></a>Working on your assignment</h2><p>You have been given a scaffold which will help you get started with this assignment. You can download<br>the scaffold onto your own computer and invoke gradle build to compile and resolve dependencies. You<br>will be using the Processing library within your project to allow you to create a window and draw<br>graphics. You can access the documentation from here.</p>
<h2 id="Gameplay"><a href="#Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay"></a>Gameplay</h2><p>The game contains a number of entities that will need to be implemented within your application.</p>
<h3 id="Board"><a href="#Board" class="headerlink" title="Board"></a>Board</h3><p>The board consists of a grid of tiles 14x14. Each tile is 48 x 48 pixels, so the total is 672 x 672 pixels.<br>However, there are 120 pixels on the right sidebar reserved for information such as timers showing the<br>number of minutes and seconds remaining on each player’s clock, and warnings or other messages for the<br>user. The window size is therefore 792x 672.</p>
<p>The board is arranged in a checkerboard pattern as below with alternating black and white tiles. These are<br>fixed and do not change. Pieces sit atop these tiles, and the tiles may change colour shade to indicate<br>highlights for particular reasons.</p>
<p>There are 4 main types of highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue – the player clicked on a piece, and it is able to move to this square.</li>
<li>Light red – the currently selected piece can move to this square, capturing the current piece there</li>
<li>Green – the player’s currently selected piece</li>
<li>Yellow – the last piece to move, and the square it came from</li>
<li>Dark red – the king on this square is currently in check, or checkmate has occurred (pieces that<br>  contribute to the checkmate are highlighted in light red)</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial piece layout is defined in a file named in the “layout” attribute of the JSON configuration file<br>described below.</p>

<p>Empty spaces are empty tiles. All maps used for marking will be valid, but you should write your own tests<br>for invalid maps and handle them as you see fit.</p>
<p>The “time_controls” section contains the amount of time to be given to player 1 and player 2 (player 2 is<br>the computer - cpu). Seconds it the total time they start with, which is consumed while they are thinking<br>about a move. The “increment” is a number in seconds added to their remaining time once they make a<br>move.</p>
<p>The “player_colour” property denotes the colour of the pieces of player 1 (the human player). It should<br>either have the value “white” or “black”. If player 1 is white, then player 2 is black. If player 1 is black,<br>then player 2 is white. Whoever is white has the first move, as in regular chess.</p>
<p>Layout file See page 5 for images of movement<br>Black White Chess piece Value Sprites Movement<br>P p Pawn 1 One space forward. Captures<br>diagonally only. If blocked, cannot<br>move.<br>R r Rook 5.25 Horizontally and vertically.</p>

<p>Q q Queen 9.5 Like Bishop + Rook</p>
<h3 id="Movement"><a href="#Movement" class="headerlink" title="Movement"></a>Movement</h3><p>The “piece_movement_speed” property in the config denotes how fast in pixels per frame a piece move<br>should occur. This is limited by the “max_movement_time”, a number in seconds that the movement<br>time should not exceed. If the movement would exceed this amount of time, the speed is increased to<br>ensure it doesn’t take longer. Moves occur at a constant speed, with the chess piece smoothly<br>transitioning in a straight line from its original position to its new position.</p>
<p>To trigger a move, the player must first select a piece by clicking on the cell it’s located in. Then, click to<br>the cell the piece should move to. If the player instead selects one of their other pieces, then that piece<br>becomes selected instead. If the player clicks on the selected piece again, or an invalid move, it becomes<br>unselected.</p>
<p>Normal movement of pieces is described in the table above. The king, queen, bishop, knight, rook and<br>pawn all have the same movement as in regular 8x8 chess. For the purposes of pawn movement,<br>“forward” is considered going up the board for the human player, and going down the board for the<br>computer player.</p>
<p>In addition, be mindful of the following special moves.</p>
<p>Special moves:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pawn can move two squares forward if it is located on 2nd row from the top or bottom of the<br>  board (rank 2 and rank 13), and has not moved before.</li>
<li>A king may perform a ‘castling’ move if it has not moved before, which allows it to move two<br>  squares horizontally in either direction so long as there is also a rook towards the direction it will<br>  move (on the same rank), and that rook hasn’t moved. When this move is performed, the rook is<br>  placed on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.</li>
<li>Pawn promotion: When a pawn reaches the 8th rank (ie. when it crosses the halfway point on the<br>  14x14 board), then it is promoted to a queen. It immediately turns into a queen and can be used<br>  as such in all subsequent moves</li>
</ul>
<p>Only a camel or knight move may jump over pieces (or the rook when castling), and a player may not<br>move a piece onto a cell already containing one of their own pieces. If a move causes the piece to enter a<br>tile containing one of the opponent’s pieces, the opponent’s piece is ‘captured’ and removed from the<br>board. All pieces capture on the same tiles as their regular movement, with the only exception being<br>pawns which capture diagonally forwards instead, if there is a piece there. This is the only time they are<br>allowed to move diagonally. If there is a piece directly in front of a pawn, it is blocked and cannot move to<br>the cell occupied by that piece.</p>
<p>Examples of possible moves for each piece are shown below.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1 : Archbishop movement<br>Figure 2 : Amazon movement<br>Figure 3 : Bishop movement</em></p>
<p><em>Figure 4 : General/Guard movement</em></p>

The king cannot<br>move to squares controlled by an<br>opponent’s piece.<br>Figure 9 : Chancellor movement. The camel<br>and generals block movement in the left<br>direction, but knight moves can still jump<br>over (same for other knight combinations).<br>Figure 10 : Pawn movement. The pawn<br>can only move diagonally when<br>capturing and cannot move directly<br>forward if blocked.<br>Figure 11 : Queen movement</em></p>
<h3 id="Check-and-Checkmate"><a href="#Check-and-Checkmate" class="headerlink" title="Check and Checkmate"></a>Check and Checkmate</h3><figure class="highlight smali"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">If after a move, a king is under attack, the king is said to be in ‘check’.</span><br><span class="line">Under this circumstance, the player whose king is in<span class="built_in"> check </span>must do one</span><br><span class="line">of the following (all must already be legal moves):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<ul>
<li>Move their king to a safe square</li>
<li>Move a piece to block the attack</li>
<li>Capture the attacking piece</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because otherwise, the player would lose their king on the next turn, and therefore lose the game.<br>If none of these possibilities are available, then the player has been checkmated – there is no move<br>available to them that would save their king, and they have lost.</p>
<p>When check occurs, the king’s square is highlighted in dark red, and the message “Check!” appears in the<br>right sidebar. If a player attempts to make an otherwise legal move that doesn’t protect their king, display<br>a message on the right sidebar: “You must defend your king!”, and the highlighted cell the king is on will<br>flash 3 times with a duration of 0.5 seconds each.</p>
<p>A player cannot make a move that would result in their king coming under attack. This could be any of<br>either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving the king to a square which is under attack by the opponent</li>
<li>Moving a piece that is blocking an attack on their king by the opponent (this piece is said to be<br>  ‘pinned’)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Computer-AI-movement"><a href="#Computer-AI-movement" class="headerlink" title="Computer AI movement"></a>Computer AI movement</h3><p>The way the computer player determines moves is up to you. It can be as simple as choosing a move<br>randomly out of all available legal moves. However, you should try and make it at least a bit intelligent.<br>For example, here is guidance on some basic rules you might want to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture a piece if the piece’s value is higher than the capturing piece, and if multiple such options<br>  exist, choose the one with the highest difference</li>
</ul>

<li>If a piece is threatened to be captured by a piece of lower value (or any piece if the threatened<br>  one is undefended), move it</li>
<li>Prefer to only move to squares that are not under attack by a piece of lower value (or even a<br>  piece of higher or equal value if the square is undefended) – let’s call these ‘safe squares’</li>
<li>If possible, attack the opponent’s king or a square adjacent to it if it’s not already under attack</li>
<li>If possible, checkmate the opponent’s king</li>
<li>If all else fails, choose a random move (prefer safe squares, but it’s possible none may be<br>  available)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Win-and-lose-conditions"><a href="#Win-and-lose-conditions" class="headerlink" title="Win and lose conditions"></a>Win and lose conditions</h3><p>The game ends when either one player runs out of time, or their king is checkmated. Then other player<br>wins.</p>
<p>If the human player wins by checkmate, display a message saying “You won by checkmate” in the right<br>sidebar. If the human player wins due to the timer, display instead “You won on time”.</p>
<p>If the human player loses by checkmate, display a message saying “You lost by checkmate” in the right<br>sidebar. If instead the cause was the timer, display “You lost on time”.</p>
<p>The player can also resign the game by pressing ‘e’ on the keyboard. The game ends and the message<br>“You resigned” is displayed in the right sidebar.</p>
<p>When the game ends, the board remains intact and<br>frozen so that the player cannot make any moves<br>(but may restart the game with the key press ‘r’). If<br>checkmate occurred, the board should highlight the<br>king of the checkmated player in red and the pieces<br>contributing to checkmate in orange. Pieces<br>contributing to checkmate are defined as a piece that<br>is either attacking the king or one of the empty<br>squares adjacent to it, or defending a piece that the<br>king could otherwise capture. For each such square,<br>there should only be one piece highlighted.</p>
<p>If there are no legal moves for a player, then the<br>game is considered a draw and enters the end state.<br>Display the message “Stalemate – draw”.</p>
<h2 id="Application"><a href="#Application" class="headerlink" title="Application"></a>Application</h2><p>Your application will need to adhere to the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The window must have dimensions 672x</li>
<li>The game must maintain a frame rate of 60 frames per second.</li>
<li>Your application must be able to compile and run on any the university lab machines (or Ubuntu<br>  VM) using gradle build &amp; gradle run. Failure to do so, will result in 0% for Final Code Submission.</li>

<li>More complex computer AI (specify difficulty in config?)</li>
<li>Option for 2-player in config (two human players)</li>
<li>Option for fog of war chess in config (Tiles not able to be moved to are greyed out. The only<br>  pieces of the opponent’s that are visible are those which are present on tiles available to be<br>  moved to. Game ends upon king capture.)</li>
<li>Sound effects</li>
<li>Expandable resizable board (drag corners to change game resolution)</li>
<li>More pawn promotion options rather than just promote to queen – user can choose while in-<br>  game</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Testcases-3"><a href="#Testcases-3" class="headerlink" title="Testcases (3%)"></a>Testcases (3%)</h3><p>During development of your code, add testcases to your project and test as much functionality as<br>possible. You will need to construct unit test cases within the src/test folder using JUnit. To test the state<br>of your entities without drawing, implement a simple loop that will update the state of each object but<br>not draw the entity.</p>
<p>Ensure your test cases cover over 90% of execution paths (Use jacoco in your gradle build) Ensure your<br>test cases cover common cases. Ensure your test cases cover edge cases. Each test case must contain a<br>brief comment explaining what it is testing. To generate the testing code coverage report with gradle<br>using jacoco, run “gradle test jacocoTestReport”.</p>
<h3 id="Design-Report-UML-and-Javadoc-3"><a href="#Design-Report-UML-and-Javadoc-3" class="headerlink" title="Design, Report, UML and Javadoc ( 3 %)"></a>Design, Report, UML and Javadoc ( 3 %)</h3><p>You will need to submit a report that elaborates on your design. This will include an explanation of any<br>object-oriented design decisions made (such as reasons for interfaces, class hierarchy, etc) and an<br>explanation of how the extension has been implemented. This should be no longer than 500 words. This<br>report will be submitted through Canvas.</p>
<p>You will need to submit a UML diagram in PDF form to Canvas to provide a brief graphical overview of<br>your code design and use of Object Oriented Principles such as inheritance and interfaces. Markers will<br>use this to determine whether you have appropriately used those principles to aid you in your design, as<br>well as figure out whether more should have been done. A general guideline is that markers will be<br>looking for some use of inheritance or interfaces, how extensible the code is, and penalising repeated<br>code. Note that you should not simply use a UML generator from an IDE such as Eclipse, as they typically<br>do not produce diagrams that conform to the format required. We suggest using software such as<br>LucidChart or draw.io for making your diagrams.</p>
<p>Your code should be clear, well commented and concise. Try to utilise OOP constructs within your<br>application and limit repetitive code. The code should follow the conventions set out by the Google Java<br>Style Guide. As part of your comments, you will need to create a Javadoc for your program. This will be<br>properly covered in week 11 but the relevant Oracle documentation can be found here.</p>
<p>Report, UML and OO design: 2%<br>Javadoc, comments, style and readability: 1 %</p>
<h3 id="Extension-2"><a href="#Extension-2" class="headerlink" title="Extension (2%)"></a>Extension (2%)</h3><p>Implement an extension as described above. Partial marks may be awarded if you choose a more limited<br>extension or it is partially completed. Please specify what extension you decided to implement within<br>your report.</p>
<h2 id="Suggested-Timeline"><a href="#Suggested-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Timeline"></a>Suggested Timeline</h2><p>Here is a suggested timeline for developing the project. Note that it is released on April 3 (start of week 7 )<br>and due May 14 (end of week 1 1 ).</p>
<p><strong>Week 7 :</strong> Familiarise yourself with gradle and processing, utilising the processing Javadoc and week 8<br>supplementary lecture. Identify opportunities to utilise Object Oriented Design principles such as<br>inheritance and interfaces and begin to plan a design for the codebase with regards to the classes that<br>you will need to make. Make a rough UML diagram for your design that you can base your codebase from.</p>
<p><strong>Week 8:</strong> Begin writing the actual code for the program. Start small, for example by initially creating the<br>board layout and pieces, then gradually add more elements. At the end of the week, you should have<br>loading in the board and piece movement finished, as well as some sprite management. If confident, use<br>Test Driven Development (writing test cases at same time as writing the code). Conduct a large amount of<br>user testing to ensure the initial mechanics work as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 9 - 10 :</strong> Develop more gameplay features, such as check, checkmate, special moves, and the<br>computer AI. Sprite management should be streamlined at this point. You should have a fairly high code<br>coverage for your test cases at this stage. If you are noticing any questionable design decisions, such as<br>God classes or classes that are doing things they logically should not be doing, this is the time to refactor<br>your code. Think about what extension you want to make and start to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>Week 11 :</strong> Finish developing the remaining features for your program, notably the configuration file, and<br>timers. Additionally, finish writing your testing suite. Create the UML and Javadoc for the program. Fix any<br>remaining bugs that your code exhibits. Submit your code to Ed (by uploading the entire project and<br>pressing MARK) and submit your UML to Canvas in PDF form.</p>
<p><strong>Week 12:</strong> Demonstrate the completed program to your tutor during the week 12 lab. They will check each<br>criteria item has successfully been completed, and may ask you questions about how you implemented it<br>to test your understanding.</p>
