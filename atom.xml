The allocation and free operations will be made against an initially empty fixed sized free memory pool. The program must support three allocation policies:</p><ul><li>First fit linked list</li><li>Best fit linked list</li><li>Buddy system power of 2 block allocation (using a minimum allocation of 32 bytes)</li></ul><h4 id="Your-program-must"><a href="#Your-program-must" class="headerlink" title="Your program must:"></a>Your program must:</h4><ol><li>Accept three command line arguments, such that argv[1] is the policy to use, argv[2] is the total memory free pool size and argv[3] is the name of the file containing the allocation and free requests. The memory size of the total free pool for the main test cases will be 1 MByte, and 512KB. You may use other sizes in any additional experiments you attempt, but make sure you describe your configuration and results in your write-up.</li><li>Read each line of the input file in argv[3] and carry out one of the following actions:</li><li>Make a memory allocation if enough memory is available to satisfy an allocation request.</li><li>Return memory to a linked list and carry out any coalescing (buddying up) required.</li><li>Refuse the allocation only if there is not enough memory to satisfy it in any available free partition. Refused requests are remembered, so that you know to take no action when you see the corresponding free operation in the input stream. (For each alloc there is a free.)</li><li>Generate one line of output for each line of input, providing information about which request this is, how the request was handled, what the total amount of free space after the request is, and what the size of the largest free partition after the request is. Sample input and output files are shown below.</li><li>So you should submit 6 files, each containing your output for the 1MB and 512KB cases for all three algorithms, and a final summary in your write-up that provides the results of each test in a format similar to:<figure class="highlight mathematica"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">First</span> <span class="keyword">Fit</span> <span class="number">1</span>MB: <span class="keyword">Total</span> Allocations <span class="number">490</span> of <span class="number">500</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">First</span> <span class="keyword">Fit</span> <span class="number">512</span>KB: <span class="keyword">Total</span> Allocations <span class="number">374</span> of <span class="number">500</span></span><br><span class="line">Best <span class="keyword">Fit</span> <span class="number">1</span>MB: <span class="keyword">Total</span> Allocations <span class="number">492</span> of <span class="number">500</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li></ol><h3 id="INPUT-FORMAT"><a href="#INPUT-FORMAT" class="headerlink" title="INPUT FORMAT:"></a>INPUT FORMAT:</h3><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">SERIAL-NUM   REQUEST   SIZE   SERIAL-MATCH</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">1</span>         alloc    <span class="number">20000</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">2</span>         alloc   <span class="number">100000</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">3</span>         alloc     <span class="number">5050</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">4</span>         free                  <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">5</span>         alloc    <span class="number">70500</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">6</span>         free                  <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">7</span>         alloc   <span class="number">400000</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="OUTPUT-FORMAT"><a href="#OUTPUT-FORMAT" class="headerlink" title="OUTPUT FORMAT:"></a>OUTPUT FORMAT:</h3><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">MANAGEMENT POLICY = First Fit       POOL SIZE = <span class="number">512</span> KB</span><br><span class="line">SERIAL-NUM   REQUEST   SIZE   ALLOC-ADDR   TOTAL-FREE   LARGEST-PART</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">1</span>         alloc    <span class="number">20000</span>           <span class="number">0</span>     <span class="number">504288</span>        <span class="number">504288</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">2</span>         alloc   <span class="number">100000</span>       <span class="number">20000</span>     <span class="number">404288</span>        <span class="number">404288</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">3</span>         alloc     <span class="number">5050</span>      <span class="number">120000</span>     <span class="number">399238</span>        <span class="number">399238</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">4</span>         free    <span class="number">100000</span>                 <span class="number">499238</span>        <span class="number">399238</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">5</span>         alloc    <span class="number">70500</span>       <span class="number">20000</span>     <span class="number">428738</span>        <span class="number">399238</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">6</span>         free     <span class="number">20000</span>           <span class="number">0</span>     <span class="number">448738</span>        <span class="number">399238</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">7</span>         alloc   <span class="number">400000</span>          <span class="number">-1</span>     <span class="number">448738</span>        <span class="number">399238</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>]]></content>

Your task will be to provide the implementation code for the BTree, InternalNode, and LeafNode classes. Since the insert methods for the nodes will be quite long, you should add new methods so that no method is more than 30 lines long. We will not grade on style, but the TAs and I will be of little help with poor quality code. You may only alter those files that will be handed in. The program will take three command line parameters: 1) filename; 2) M, the number of children that internal nodes have; and 3) L, the number of integers each leaf node holds. The input file will not include more than 1000 integers. Since only integers will be stored in the BTree class, I did not implement it as a template. When a node splits, the new node created will always contain at least as many entries as the remaining old node, and will contain the larger values. The output must match that shown in the sample.</p><p>There is one change in the data structure from the book’s; the internal nodes should keep track of the minimum value for every child. You will find this easier than not having the minimum for the first child.</p><p>How did I write this code so fast? I used procedural abstraction. I thought about the tasks, their subtasks, and the subtasks of those subtasks. (You should write them down.) If I could state a subtask, then I planned on writing a separate function to do just that subtask. I found that the tasks of the InternalNode class matched that of the LeafNode class, so I postponed as much work on the InternalNode class as long as possible so that I could learn from my LeafNode mistakes. I worked top down with stubs for the subtasks, and got that iteration to compile without warnings! This avoids making the same mistake repeatedly—the compiler is a very good teacher. When I could do even minimal testing, I did it. What I learned from debugging kept me from duplicating those mistakes in later code, and reminded me of issues that I had forgot about. Sometimes when I addressed a new issue in a method I discovered that I had to add a lot of code. If there is a whole lot of new code, the issue deserved its own method with an appropriate name. It is a simple matter of cutting and pasting, and keeps each method short, and understandable. By the time I was done my LeafNode class had nine methods, and no method has more than 30 lines. Once the LeafNode class worked perfectly, I copied the LeafNode class methods as InternalNode class methods, and did a search and replace from values to keys! Though there are child sibling and parent issues for the InternalNode class, the basic LeafNode code provided a great starting point. In the end my InernalNode class had 13 methods. In comparison to the first time I wrote this with long insert functions a few years ago, the debugging was much faster this time because of the small methods</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="User-to-User-Chats"><a href="#User-to-User-Chats" class="headerlink" title="User to User Chats"></a>User to User Chats</h3><p>In this part you will be enhancing your client to allow for communication between other clients. In order to separate individual user to user chats, you will need to implement a chat executable program which your client will execute as child processes. Using the xterm program in tandem with this chat executable you’ll be able to create a client that spawns new windows as needed to display chats. The behavior will emulate what you may be familiar with on facebook or google hangouts functionality in terms of automatically spawning new small windows dedicated for chatting as opposed to monopolizing the user’s entire view of the screen.</p><p>When a client wants to begin a chat session with another user, they type into the client window on stdin the client command /chat. This will trigger the client to send to the server a new verb, MSG. The MSG verb will be used for communication of ALL chat messages between the server and client. Let’s consider an example:</p><ol><li>Paul initiates chat using the /chat command, the message is formatted into the MSG\r\n\r\n protocol and sent to the server.<br>When the server receives the MSG verb, it sends the same message back to both the To and FROM user.</li><li>When Paul’s and Neal’s client receive the MSG\r\n\r\n back from the server, the client program will create a UNIX Domain Socket to share with the child process (for the pop-up chat window) to communicate over, then fork and execv an xterm terminal which will run your ./chat program.</li><li>The chat program is a simple program which takes input from stdin and sends to the Client program, prints on stdout messages from the client program, and handles the command /close which terminates the child process (same as closing the terminal window).</li></ol><p>This is the initial creation of all user to user chats. Once both users have an xterm chat window open for communication, the users can freely type messages to each other. Incoming messages should be proceeded by the &gt; symbol and outgoing messages by &lt; in the chat window. With each message entered in the xterm on stdin, the chat program should relay the information to the client through their Unix Domain socket. The client then converts the message into the Wolfie Protocol MSG verb and sends to the server. The below figure illustrates the steps.</p><p>A user can close a chat window at anytime using either the close button on the xterm window or by using the command /close. When the window is closed on one client it has no impact on the client who was chatting with the user. In the figure below Paul closed the chat window but Neal still has it open. When Neal types a message to Paul it is sent to the server (Step 1). The sewer will forward the message back to Paul &amp; Neal (Step 2). Since Paul has no existing window, his client creates a new window and displays the message. Neal’s client will just display the message since the xterm is already open.</p><p>Paul closed the chat window and then wants to send Neal a new message. To initiate the chat again, he would need to type /chat command in his client. This will send the MSG verb to the sewer (Step 1 in figure below). Upon the server’s response, Paul’s client would spawn a new chat window. Neal and Paul’s chat windows will then both display the</p><p>Overall, the protocol MSG verb is generic. The server has no knowledge of the chat windows open or closed. It is the client program’s responsibility to open, close, and manage the chat windows. In this way, it doesn’t matter if the xterm window is closed because every time MSG is received the client will check to see if a window already exists for communicating with theuser and if not it will fork and exec a new xterm process to become the window needed for communication. If the window does exist then the message is passed through the Unix domain socket and displayed appropriately on the chat window.</p><p>If one of the user’s disconnects from the server or does not exist, but a message is sent to this user, the server will respond with an ERR message.</p><h3 id="Added-Client-command"><a href="#Added-Client-command" class="headerlink" title="Added Client command"></a>Added Client command</h3><h4 id="chat"><a href="#chat" class="headerlink" title="/chat"></a>/chat</h4><p>The /chat command requires the name of the user to send the message to and the message to be sent. The client program will send to the server the MSG verb to communicate the message to the other user.</p><h4 id="logout"><a href="#logout" class="headerlink" title="/logout"></a>/logout</h4><p>Update the functionality of the command to now additionally close all the chat windows and all file descriptors prior to exiting the client program.</p><h3 id="Chat-Program"><a href="#Chat-Program" class="headerlink" title="Chat Program"></a>Chat Program</h3><p>Usage:<br><figure class="highlight fortran"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">./chat UNIX_SOCKET_FD</span><br><span class="line">UNIX_SOCKET_FD          The Unix Domain <span class="keyword">File</span> Descriptor <span class="keyword">number</span>.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>When the server sends MSG verb to your client it should fork and exec xterm, which in turn will exec your chat program in a basic terminal. This will act as the interface to communicate with another user much like chats on Facebook or hangouts work. These will act as the small popups to chat in while the client remains the manager for the connection with the server. The chat program will use Unix domain sockets to communicate with the parent client process. Using socketpair() you can declare two anonymous sockets and pass the file descriptor to the chat program as an argument. You can also declare the sockets as you would normally using socket(). In either case you must use AF_UNIX as the domain.</p><p>xterm is a powerful terminal emulator as it allows for a lot of customization using command line arguments. You should study the man page for xterm to see what arguments will help make your program as easy to use as possible. To get you started, the format to fork and exec the ./chatprogram in xterm is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Example execution string: “xterm -geometry 45x35+%d -T %s -e ./chat. %d”</p></blockquote><p>Each of the arguments have the following meaning.</p><ul><li><p>-geometry geometry: This argument allows you to set the size and location of the xterm window opened. Geometry format is described here under “geometry specifications”. However, all you really need to know is that is takes the format WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF where width and height are in characters and XOFF and YOFF is in pixels. In the suggested execution string above you can see that you can omit the YOFF value and you can use sprintf to set the XOFF so the windows spawned are not stacked on one another.</p></li><li><p>-T string: With this flag you can set the title of the string to the username being communicated with so the user has a quick reference of which window is chatting with whom. Use %s format specifier to insert the username for the chat.</p></li><li><p>-e program [arguments … ]: finally there is the most important flag. -e specifies the executable to be run when the terminal opens. The arguments to the program follow immediately after as you would type them in the terminal. The execution string shows how you would pass the unix domain socket file descriptor. Use %s format specifier for the file descriptor of the Unix domain socket.</p></li></ul><p>The chat program should prompt the user for input, anything the user types in followed by pressing the enter-key should be considered a message with the exception of the /close command. The /close command simply closes the window and the Unix domain socket in the parent. There is no protocol messages that need to be exchanged with the server when this command is used. The Client forwards each MSG received to the corresponding chat window via each open chat’s Unix domain socket.</p><p>The protocol has new verbs that must be implemented to support these user features. As we have seen in the figures, the MSG verb will deliver the information of who the message is to, whom it is from, and the message being sent. Additionally, add a new verb, UOFF, which will be used to notify ALL clients connected to the server of a user logging out or disconnecting from the server.</p><h3 id="Client-crash-or-error-termlnatlon"><a href="#Client-crash-or-error-termlnatlon" class="headerlink" title="Client crash or error termlnatlon"></a>Client crash or error termlnatlon</h3><p>Crashes happen so the UOFF verb should handle both the case of a client disconnecting and of a client logging off. If someone’s chatting partner disconnects and the chat window is still open for that user, when the UOFF verb is received, the chat window should print a message that informs the user of the disconnection. The xterm window should then close on any key press. This is to prevent the user from attempting to send anything to a disconnected user. Think about how the server can handle errors when trying to pass along user messages, and accordingly turn that error into a UOFF broadcast verb to notify all clients of the user’s disconnection.</p><h3 id="Server"><a href="#Server" class="headerlink" title="Server"></a>Server</h3><p>On the server side the communication threads must handle receiving and sending messages to the proper clients using the MSGprotocol defined in the prior figures. The server also must handle forwarding the UOFF verb to all still connected clients when a user disconnects or logs off the server.</p>]]></content>

Study the figure carefully and ask clarification question on piazza.</p><p>The client begins by automatically using the command line args (see usage below) to connect to the server. It then proceeds to the login stage which at this time will be automatic as all that needs to be sent to the server is the client’s username. However, use some planning when implementing this section as you will later add support to ask the user for a password while logging in. Upon a successful login your client proceeds to block on I/O Multiplexing, this means your program is waiting on input from either the server’s socket or stdin.</p><ol><li>When receiving input your program will diverge depending on where the input comes from. In the case of stdin your client will handle the command given and do what is described below for the given command.</li><li>When receiving input from the server socket, your program will handle the protocol as described in the document. One example would be, printing the time logged when the EM IT verb is received from the server.</li></ol><h3 id="Usage"><a href="#Usage" class="headerlink" title="Usage:"></a>Usage:</h3><figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">.<span class="built_in">/client </span>[-hcv] NAME SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT</span><br><span class="line">-h           Displays this help menu, <span class="keyword">and</span> returns EXIT_SUCCESS.</span><br><span class="line">-c           Requests <span class="keyword">to</span><span class="built_in"> server </span><span class="keyword">to</span> create a new user</span><br><span class="line">-v           Verbose <span class="builtin-name">print</span> all<span class="built_in"> incoming </span><span class="keyword">and</span> outgoing protocol verbs content</span><br><span class="line">NAME         This is the username <span class="keyword">to</span> display when chatting.</span><br><span class="line">SERVER_IP    The ipaddress of the<span class="built_in"> server </span><span class="keyword">to</span> connect <span class="keyword">to</span>.</span><br><span class="line">SERVER_PORT  The<span class="built_in"> port </span><span class="keyword">to</span> connect <span class="keyword">to</span>.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To make things easier to read, use the ansii escape codes to help color your messages on the client as you did with the server.</p><h3 id="WOLFIE-Protocol"><a href="#WOLFIE-Protocol" class="headerlink" title="WOLFIE Protocol"></a>WOLFIE Protocol</h3><p>Now we will attempt to describe the protocol. This is how the server and client program communicate with each other. It is important that you follow the protocol described exactly. During the grading process we will test your client program with a server we have made and your server with a client we have made. As long as you follow the protocol correctly none of this should matter.</p><p>In the diagrams we use the symbol CR to represent \r and NL to represent \n (The software that creates the diagram parses \n as a newline so we had to change the symbols).

The client will initiate the login transaction with the server by sending the WOLFIE verb to the server. The server will respond to the client by replying with EIFLOW (wolfie backwards). Then the server can expect the client to identify itself with the IAM verb. If everything is correct, the server will respond with HI. At this point the client is logged in. You should retain their login time in the data structure you employed to store user information. You can now send a follow up message to the client which alerts them to the message of the day by sending MOTD. The MOTD should print out on the client upon receipt.</p><blockquote><p>The ellipses … represent that there is more communication further down, but just not illustrated in this part of the diagram.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Failed-login"><a href="#Failed-login" class="headerlink" title="Failed login"></a>Failed login</h3><p>It is possible for a login attempt to fail.

The client will send BYE and then receive a BYE response from the server. Implementing the client so that it waits for confirmation from the server is a polite way of making sure the server has properly removed the user from it’s data structures and is in an acceptable state for the user to then disconnect.</p><h3 id="Shutdown-server-initiates"><a href="#Shutdown-server-initiates" class="headerlink" title="Shutdown (server initiates)"></a>Shutdown (server initiates)</h3><p>Finally if the user were to type /shutdown it would initiate the above protocol to terminate the connection with all connected users.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>he Wolfie Chat program will allow users logged into the the Wolfie Chat server to send messages to each other. Chats between users will each be displayed on the client machine in independent windows, just as Google Hangouts does.</p><p>Clients will attempt to establish a connection with the server through the accept thread. The accept thread on the server will create a connection with the Client and spawn the Login Thread. The Login thread will then communicate with the client via the Wolfie Protocol to successful/unsuccessfully log the user into the Wolfie Chat system. Upon successful/unsuccessful login, the Login thread will terminate. A Login thread will be created for each connection attempt and terminated upon completion. Multiple login threads can exist simultaneously if multiple users are attempting to login.</p><p>If the user is successfully logged on, then the server will act as the middle man for all communications between the users connected to the server. A Communication thread on the server will be spawned when the first user logs onto the server and terminate when no user is logged in. This thread will then service all additional users who connect. An overview of the architecture is shown below.</p><h3 id="Part-I-Establishing-a-connection"><a href="#Part-I-Establishing-a-connection" class="headerlink" title="Part I - Establishing a connection"></a>Part I - Establishing a connection</h3><p>In this part we will work on establishing a simple login procedure between the client and server program. At the end of it you should have multiple users logged in who can simply ask the server “how long have I been connected”. The server should then respond to the correct user and let them know how long. Also the client should be able to ask “who else is connected” and the server will return a list of connected users. Once this part is completed, you should be able to extend the concepts to make a more complex application which will allow users connected with the server to communicate with each other.</p><h3 id="Server"><a href="#Server" class="headerlink" title="Server"></a>Server</h3><p>Below is a diagram representing the internal control flow of the server program. As discussed above this is the main accept thread which is running when the server program is run. Login threads are spawned as necessary to handle each user’s login attempt. A successfully logged in user then communicates with the server via the communication thread.</p><h3 id="Accept-Thread-main"><a href="#Accept-Thread-main" class="headerlink" title="Accept Thread (main())"></a>Accept Thread (main())</h3><p>The primary server program will accept commands from the user via stdin and connections from the client program via the bound “listen” socket. When the server accepts an incoming connection from a client it should spawn a new login thread and begin the login process. If it detects input from the keyboard, it should parse that input for a list of commands and handle it accordingly. This section of the process will use a form of I/O multiplexing to listen for input on both the server socket and from stdin.</p><p>I/O multiplexing is exposed via the following interfaces - select, poll, or epoll. They all have their pros and cons, but it is up to you to choose which technique you should use. You will use I/O multiplexing in both the server and your client program. In your server, you will multiplex on each socket for the connected users in the communication thread, and in the accept thread you will multiplex on the accept socket and stdin.</p><p>The benefits of I/O multiplexing are that the program will be put into a suspended state while no activity is being performed on the fd’s, and when one of the fd’s is written to, it will alert your program that something happens, and you can then act on it. The other benefits to these techniques is that they work in a synchronous manner, but allow you to have behavior similar to doing things concurrently, without the overhead of spawning new threads, or starting new processes.</p><h3 id="Login-Thread"><a href="#Login-Thread" class="headerlink" title="Login Thread"></a>Login Thread</h3><p>When a client connects to the server, the server should spawn a thread to handle the login protocol with the server. The login protocol is defined later in Part I. The Login thread will need to check the list of users on the server (shared resource between server threads) to see if the username is already in use. If the name is not in use, the login thread will then complete the protocol to log the user into the server. We will simply treat login for this part as a first come first serve process. If student1 logs in as user1 then student2 tries to login as user1, student1 will successfully log in and student2 will be rejected. Any relevant data about the connecting user should be a of structure you define that makes their information easily accessible. An in-exhaustive list of things relevant to save are: the time of login, the socket on which they communicate, the username, and the ip address. You are encouraged to add any other fields of data that assist in your implementation.</p><h3 id="Communication-Thread"><a href="#Communication-Thread" class="headerlink" title="Communication Thread"></a>Communication Thread</h3><p>When there is at least one user logged in to the server a thread must be spawned to handle the communication to and from the server and later between all of the clients. In your communication thread you will use I/O multiplexing on the set of file descriptors (fds) used to communicate with the clients.</p><blockquote><p>You must use I/O multiplexing.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Server-commands"><a href="#Server-commands" class="headerlink" title="Server commands"></a>Server commands</h3><p>Aside from handling connections from various clients, the server also has to handle input from stdin. This input should represent commands that the person operating the server might want to use. These commands are transparent to the clients connected and are mainly used as a way to gather information by the server operator.</p><h5 id="users"><a href="#users" class="headerlink" title="/users"></a>/users</h5><p>When /users is typed into the server’s terminal it should dump a list of currently logged in users to stdout (NOTE: this does not send anything over the network, this is only on the server side.). This can be a great way to debug your program, it is advised you take some time to make neatly formatted print statements that print out relevant data. (Think, toString() function for your user structs).</p><h5 id="help"><a href="#help" class="headerlink" title="/help"></a>/help</h5><p>When /help is typed into the server’s terminal it should list all the commands which the server accepts and what they do.</p><h5 id="shutdown"><a href="#shutdown" class="headerlink" title="/shutdown"></a>/shutdown</h5><p>When /shutdown is typed into the server’s terminal it should cleanly disconnect all connected users. Save any state that it must and then close all the sockets and files which it is using and free any heap memory allocated.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>In this assignment you will be creating a chat service much like Google’s Hangouts, called Wolfie Chat. The goal is to learn about network programming in C. You will implement the service so that it adheres to the Wolfie Protocol.</p><p>The concept of a protocol is an important one to understand. When implementing the protocol you need to follow the requirements and description TO THE LETTER. The idea is to create a standard so that anyone implementing the Wolfie Protocol will be able to connect and operate with any other program implementing the same protocol. Any client and chat should work with any server if the protocol is used correctly (HINT HINT think grading).</p><p>Certain public networks like wolfienet secure or starbucks will not allow you to connect your client and server together over the network. You may also want to test your client by connecting to another group’s server, and your server by having other group’s clients connect to it. This is a good way to ensure that the protocol is implemented correctly in your client/server programs. While we encourage testing this way, THIS IS NOT an open invitation to share code with other groups. You should not be showing or sharing code with anyone else. To perform these tests you should simply be telling your client programs to connect to the IP address and port number at which these servers are running at. You have been warned!</p><h3 id="Groups"><a href="#Groups" class="headerlink" title="Groups"></a>Groups</h3><p>In this assignment you are allowed groups of two members. Unless stated otherwise, we will assume that you are in the same group as the previous assignment. If you wish to divorce your partner from the previous assignment and assemble a new group please follow the directions in hw4.</p><h3 id="Getting-started"><a href="#Getting-started" class="headerlink" title="Getting started"></a>Getting started</h3><p>Make the directory hw5 in the root of your git repository. All files which you create for this assignment should be placed in this directory. You should also create a Makefile, which generates the server program called server, a client program called client, and your chat program called chat.

Test out each part as you implement it to ensure that it works (don’t just build the entire thing separately and hope it all works in the end.) It’s also okay to test both the server and client locally on your own machine, but you really should test it out over a real network as well.</p><h3 id="Helpful-Resources"><a href="#Helpful-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Helpful Resources"></a>Helpful Resources</h3><p>You should make sure you understand chapter 11, 12.2, and 12.3 in your textbook.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="I-OBJECTIVES"><a href="#I-OBJECTIVES" class="headerlink" title="I. OBJECTIVES"></a>I. OBJECTIVES</h3><p>The purpose of this assignment is to build a package of timing routines for the SAPC and use it to time code on the SAPC to determine memory access time on the SAPC with and without caching. This code does not run on UNIX. Read the Intel 8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) Data Sheet. Look at $pcex/timer.c for an example of C code for accessing the timer. Copy all the files needed for this project.</p><h3 id="II-The-timing-package"><a href="#II-The-timing-package" class="headerlink" title="II. The timing package"></a>II. The timing package</h3><p>A package is a set of utilities that can be called by a program that wants to use them. When designing a package we carefully consider the things in it that must be visible to the caller, specify those, and require that everything else be internal and invisible. The visible parts of the timing package you will build are in “timepack.h”. A customer for the package’s services includes that header file (using #include) in the program for compilation and links his or her object code with “timepack_sapc.opc” to build the executable. You are asked to modify “timepack_sapc.c” to provide a high resolution timer service for programs running on the SAPC.</p><h3 id="Existing-Code"><a href="#Existing-Code" class="headerlink" title="Existing Code"></a>Existing Code</h3><p>Every package should have a test program showing that it works by calling it in all important ways. This test program is called a “driver” because it sits on top of the package and drives it like we test-drive a car – start up, do this, do that, stop, shut down. It is also called a “unit test” program because it tests just this one package separate from any other package in a bigger program. If you suspect something is wrong in a certain package, you’ll try to make its unit test fail, and then you debug the problem in the relatively simple environment of the unit test, rather than in the bigger program. The test program for timepack is testpack.c. You can build testpack and testpack.lnx right away and run them. Note what is printed out by testpack.lnx. Capture this in a typescript1 file. It shows that the timing package (as provided) can time things on the SAPC to 55-ms accuracy, but not to the microsecond accuracy we want. The next step is to get your timepack_sapc.c fixed up for the higher resolution and the unit test executable testpack.lnx will show it.</p><p>Modifed Code<br>You’re working directly with the hardware device, the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) with its interrupt handler. This code has been provided to you in a). The timepack_sapc.c as provided can measure time in timer “ticks” at an 18.2-Hz (55 ms/tick) standard PC tick rate.To use the PIT to measure higher precision, you make use of “downcounts” within the timer chip. What you need to do is determine how many counts have downcounted in the timer since the last tick and compute a higher accuracy time. By doing this at both the start and the end of the time interval being measured, you can compute the elapsed time accurate to a few microseconds, a very respectable timer service. You’ll need to modify the timepack_sapc.c to achieve this.</p><p>Since timer downcounts count down from 64K at the tick, you need to subtract the register value from 65536 to get the number of downcounts since last tick:<br><figure class="highlight applescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">number</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> downcounts <span class="keyword">since</span> tick = <span class="number">65536</span> - observed_count (<span class="keyword">in</span> register)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Thus the accurate time between A and B is<br><figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">= 202<span class="built_in"> clock </span>ticks + (65536 – 43000) downcounts - (200<span class="built_in"> clock </span>ticks + (65536 – 35000) downcounts)</span><br><span class="line">= 2<span class="built_in"> clock </span>ticks – 8000 downcounts</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><h3 id="III-Timing-i486-instructions-and-a-C-loop"><a href="#III-Timing-i486-instructions-and-a-C-loop" class="headerlink" title="III. Timing i486 instructions and a C loop"></a>III. Timing i486 instructions and a C loop</h3><p>In this part of the assignment you will use the timing package to time x86 instructions. Instruction execution time is measured in system clock cycles, here 2.5 nsecs for our 400Mhz Pentium systems. The PC timer 0 is accurate only in the usec (microsecond) range so you will need to loop many times and divide by the loop count to get the accuracy needed.</p><p>The actual instructions to be timed appear in loops in “itests.s”, which is an x86 assembler source. These are called from itimes.c.</p><p>Finish “itests.s”, so that the third instruction to be timed (immediate move of IDATA to register) is properly implemented. Add a fourth instruction of your choice “itests.s” and “itimes.c”</p><p>You can use the provided makefile to build an optimized version of the SAPC executable file.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>OpenGL is a relative low-level 3d API which does not support object/scene management. This is usually left to the user of the API. For example, importing and exporting data to and from OpenGL has to be implemented by the application programmer. Hierarchical structures although indirectly supported using Push and Pop matrix operations have no direct support in OpenGL.<br>You task is to develop a set of C++ classes / data structures and algorithms that provide a high level OpenGL object/scene management for one of the following:</p><ol><li>Develop a small library that provide an interface that allows the simulation of real world physic such as gravity, friction springs; To demonstrate the library a simple particle system with physics and collisions could be written.</li><li>A simple 3D game using OpenGL which should allow for the detection of object collisions in 3D space and user control of the game characters. (3D space invaders would be a good example).</li><li>Develop a framework that allows the simulation of a Craig Reynolds-like flocking system using OpenGL. The system should allow for any number of boids to be added to the scene, with detection of objects within a scene.<br>.4 Develop a system that provide an interface that allows L-systems (Lindermayer systems) based modelling of plant like structures using OpenGL. The L system should read in the grammar of the system from a file.</li><li>A simple raytracing framework that will read a scene file and render out the scene using materials / lights supplied in the scene file.</li><li>Other project Ideas may be discussed with the unit leader.</li></ol><h3 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h3><p>You are required to use the NGL graphics library as part of the assignment, if more functionality is required a software update request can be made to Jon Macey or you may use other libraries but this must be justified in the design of the project. It is also expected that the project uses the main Qt development system and is capable of running within this environment. Third party libraries such as GLUT should not be used, however if you are developing a game SDL could be considered.</p><p>It is suggested that the program be written using C++ and OpenGL however any system may be used for the final program.<br>For example Python exporting to renderman for rendering would be acceptable, however realtime visualisation with OpenGL for the system would be a bonus.</p><h3 id="Part-1-Research-and-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Research-and-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Research and Design"></a>Part 1: Research and Design</h3><p>For the first part of the project a report should be submitted containing initial research into the topic including references to sources and initial design consideration for the project. Marks will be awarded for clarity of research and use of images / algorithms. Initial design of the C++ data structures and algorithms required should also be carried out however no code is expected to be submitted at this stage. Note that it is expected that most of the design will be in the form of a “programming sketch book” using hand drawn data diagrams, a full written report is not expected at this stage. The main emphasis is the research and design into the area chosen. At this stage we are more interested in Code design and the algorithmic approach to the problem and not the cosmetic / artistic design of the program.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Implementation"><a href="#Part-2-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Implementation"></a>Part 2: Implementation</h3><p>The 2nd part of the assignment involves the implementation of the system based on the initial research and design. As software design is an iterative process it is expected that the actual program will have evolved from the initial report and this process should be reflected on in the final project report. Marks will be awarded for good use of C++, data structure design and documentation of the code with respect to and algorithms and techniques used.</p><p>The program must be able to be configured by the use of a text based configuration file to set-up initial program states or values.</p><h3 id="INTENDED-LEARNING-OUTCOMES"><a href="#INTENDED-LEARNING-OUTCOMES" class="headerlink" title="INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES"></a>INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3><p>This assignment will allow you to demonstrate your ability of the following learning outcomes.</p><ul><li>understand and apply Object Oriented concepts and techniques to the design and implementation of CGI systems</li><li>demonstrate an ability to analyze and select suitable data structures for program development.</li><li>demonstrate an ability to understand and implement computer animation related algorithms using OOP</li><li>develop GUI based systems using a suitable API for animation</li></ul>]]></content>

The word “codec” is a contraction of two words: “COde” and “DECode”. This ADT does the work of coding and decoding using a Huffman tree. The Huffman Codec is a record that stores two records: the Huffman Tree thatwas created in the previous exercise, and a codebook, which was created by analysing the Huffman tree. The codebook has a place to store a C-string for every ASCII character, though most of the codebook will be filled with NULL references; only the characters in the original message will have a code. The function find_codes() builds the codebook using the Huffman Tree.</p><p>In this exercise, you’ll complete the encode() operations for the Huffman Codec. Here’s what it looks like currently:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// encode(hcdc, message)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// encode a message using the Huffman Codec</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Pre: hcdc is a referene to a HuffmanCodec</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//      message:: a cstring to encode</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Return a cstring containing the encoded message</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">char</span> *<span class="title">encode</span><span class="params">(HuffmanCodec *h, <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">char</span> message[])</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> complete this function</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">NULL</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Your job is to complete this function.</p><h3 id="Hints"><a href="#Hints" class="headerlink" title="Hints"></a>Hints</h3><p>The operation has to encode each character in the given message. The output of this function is a reference to a C-string, so we have to allocate a C-string big enough to fill with the encoded message. Use a large size, just to be sure.</p><p>To encode the message, you have to look at each character in the message, and copy its code from the Codec’s codebook to the encoded C-string. It’s possible to use strcat() for this, but it’s just as easy to write your own loop to copy the code for a character from the codebook to the coded C-string. Remember that you’re looking at the message one character at a time, but you are copying several characters into the coded C-string.</p><p>The encoded C-string is probably twice as long as the original message. That’s because we’re using ‘0’ and ‘1’ in the codebook; a real compression utility would use bits 0 and 1, not characters. That’s okay for us; seeing the code is much easier to debug.</p><h3 id="Exercise-Summary"><a href="#Exercise-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Exercise Summary"></a>Exercise Summary</h3><p>Complete encode() as indicated.</p><p>Build the testADT app, and run it.</p><p>If your code does the right things, tests 45-48 should all report “Passed.”</p><h3 id="Exercise-8-Completing-the-Huffman-Codec-ADT"><a href="#Exercise-8-Completing-the-Huffman-Codec-ADT" class="headerlink" title="Exercise 8 Completing the Huffman Codec ADT"></a>Exercise 8 Completing the Huffman Codec ADT</h3><p>To complete the Huffman Codec, we need an algorithm to decode a coded string. The operation to decode a coded string is called decode(). We’ve given it to you in the file Huffman.cc. It calls a function called decode_char(), whose job it is to step through the Huffman tree, starting at the root, and winding up at a leaf; decode_char() returns the character stored in the Frequency record stored at the leaf. (We cannot use the codebook for decoding! We have to use the Huffman Tree. To decode a character using the Huffman tree requires us to step down from tbhe root to a leaf, which should be fairly short. The complexity of stepping through the tree is O(h) where h is the height of the Huffman Tree. If we used the codebook, we’d have to look at each possible code, and try to figure out if the code we’re looking at is a code in the codebook. This would require at least O(nh) time, where n is the number of characters in the message. So use the tree!</p><p>Here’s what decode_char() looks like currently:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// decode_char(tnode, message, d) &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// decode one character from the message.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Pre: tnode is a node in a huffman tree</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//      message:: cstring, the whole message to decode</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//      d:: a reference to an int containing the current</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//          index in the message</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Post: d has been increased by the number of 0s and 1s used to</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//       encode the character</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Return: the decoded character</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">char</span> <span class="title">decode_char</span><span class="params">(TreeNode *t, <span class="keyword">char</span> message[], <span class="keyword">int</span> *d)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> complete this function</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">'.'</span>; <span class="comment">// dot returned for no good reason</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Your job is to complete this function.</p>]]></content>

Because these are very specific operations for the Huffman tree algorithm, it is better to build a wrapper ADT than to put these special purpose operations in the List ADT.</p><p>The FrequencyList constructor currently looks like this:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// createFrequencyList(message)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Pre: message:: refToChar, the message to be encoded</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Return: a reference to the generated list.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// post: a new list is allocated</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// return: reference to the new list</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">FrequencyList *<span class="title">createFrequencyList</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">char</span>* message)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (message == <span class="literal">NULL</span>)</span><br><span class="line">  &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">cerr</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="string">"Error in createFrequencyList(): NULL message!"</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="built_in">endl</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">NULL</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> complete this function</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">NULL</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The constructor should do the following:</p><ol><li>Walk through the message, character by character, counting how many times each character is used. Use an integer array for this.</li><li>Once the whole message has been seen, use the array to build a Frequency record for each character seen at least once.</li><li>Build a TreeNode for each Frequency record, and then store the TreeNode in the List. Each Tree will be a leaf node for now. We’ll use the initialized list in a later exercise.</li><li>Return the FrequencyList full of TreeNodes.</li></ol><p>In the lecture slides on Huffman trees, the character and frequency data were attributes of the Tree record itself.</p><p>In this assignment, we are using Frequency records to store the character and frequency values. This adds another ADT to think about, but it allows us to reuse the ordinary tree that simply stores a single Element. This is good software reuse (of Trees) and adaptability: if we want to store other data in the Tree, we can change the Frequency ADT, and most if not all of the rest of the application would not need to change.</p><h3 id="Hints-on-counting-characters"><a href="#Hints-on-counting-characters" class="headerlink" title="Hints on counting characters"></a>Hints on counting characters</h3><p>Each character you can type or use on a computer has an integer value; for letters and digits and normal keyboard symbols, this is called the ASCII value. For example, the letter ‘c’ has an ASCII value of 99. Because of this, we can use a character as an index into a characeter count array like this: counts[‘c’]. We can do this for any character, whether it’s ‘c’ or ‘&amp;’.</p><p>To calculate the frequency of each letter in a message, we use an array of counts (initialized to 0). Each time we observe a character in a message, we can increase its count. For example to increase the count for the letter ‘c’, we would do the following:<br><figure class="highlight mipsasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">counts['c'] </span>+= <span class="number">1</span><span class="comment">;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>This will increase the count of the integer at index 99 (the one corresponding to the letter ‘c’). The letter ‘c’ is the 99th character in the ASCII character set, and its counter is the 100th in our counts array. To initialize the counts array, we have the following:</p><figure class="highlight nimrod"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">int</span> counts[<span class="type">ASCII_SIZE</span>]; // <span class="type">ASCII_SIZE</span> <span class="keyword">is</span> defined <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="type">LOCALE</span>.h</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="built_in">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="type">ASCII_SIZE</span>; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  counts[i] = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here we’re using integers, not characters, to index into the array. This is okay, because in a sense, characters are integers. Characters have special status when we want to think of them as characters, but they also have integer values which we use when that’s handy.</p><p>One problem remains: with compiler flags -Wall and -pedantic, the compiler may complain when you use a character as an array index:<br>warning: array subscript has type ‘char’ [-Wchar-subscripts]</p><p>To get rid of these warnings, we can use a technique called typecasting. Typecasting tells the compiler to treat a variable of one type as though it has a different type. For example, we can typecast a character to an integer as follows:<br><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">counts[(<span class="keyword">int</span>) <span class="string">'c'</span>] += <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The use of (int) in brackets in front of a value tells the compiler that it’s not a mistake to try to use the value ‘c’ as an integer (99). Typecasting can also be done when you want to force a float to be truncated into a integer, or something like that. We’ll only use it for characters in this asignment.</p><h3 id="Exercise-Summary"><a href="#Exercise-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Exercise Summary"></a>Exercise Summary</h3><ol><li>Complete createFrequencyList() as indicated.</li><li>Build the testADT app, and run it.</li><li>If your code does the right things, tests 33-34 should all report “Passed.”</li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Task-description"><a href="#Task-description" class="headerlink" title="Task description"></a>Task description</h3><p>This is a programming assignment. Get started early! Unanticipated problems will arise in your work, and you will need time to sort them out.</p><p>Clarifying questions can be posted on the CMPT 115 Moodle forums. Help with debugging can be obtained by working in the lab during Help Desk hours of your instructors and TAs. Expect high demand for this kind of help on Fridays.</p><p>All C++ source code files must contain your name, student number, and NSID; and the course, assignment number, and question number as comments at the top of the file. All C++ programs must compile with g++ on the command line without errors or warnings, using the standard flags described in tutorial, namely -Wall -pedantic.</p><p>You may, of course, work on your assignment using Eclipse, or any other C++ IDE, on your personal notebooks or desktops, or on any computer in the Spinks labs. We cannot always help you with problems arising specifically from the IDE, but C++ should have the same bahaviour on all these systems. There are good reasons to use an IDE like Eclipse or MSVS, but there are good reasons to learn to use the command-line too. Learn both!</p><p>Use of String class or string or other object-oriented code (except for cin or cout and any others explicitly allowed in an assignment specification) will result in a flat deduction of 25%. (That means: don’t use advanced techniques to avoid learning the concepts we are attempting to teach you!)</p><h3 id="The-Big-Picture"><a href="#The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="The Big Picture"></a>The Big Picture</h3><p>For this assignment, you will be implementing the Huffman Tree encoding algorithm for file compression. We’re giving you 2 weeks for all of this work. It’s crucial that you do not leave it to the last minute. (All this talk about code is confusing; sometimes the word code refers to C++ code. Sometimes it refers to the Huffman code. And, unfortunately, we will have to refer to ASCII code as well. We’ll try to be clear.)</p><p>The main application here to read a file, say message.txt, containing some text, and then to translate (“encode”) the text using the Huffman code. Your program will write the Huffman coded text to a new file, say coded-message.txt. Your program will also be required to read the very same Huffman coded text from coded-message.txt, and decode it, resulting in an exact duplicate of original message. This will demonstrate that your application uses the Huffman code correctly.</p><p>This is almost a real application. It’s artificial in the sense that your main program will encode and decode the same message. A real file-compression application will either encode a file, or decode it, but usually not both. Students who want a challenge can go beyond the requirements to write a file compression utility. Another unrealistic aspect is that we’re using a text-file as the compressed file, which actually causes the “compressed file” to be larger than the original. Don’t worry about that; the Huffman code, and the use of lists and trees is what we’re interested in.</p><h3 id="Files-and-more-files"><a href="#Files-and-more-files" class="headerlink" title="Files and more files"></a>Files and more files</h3><p>We’re giving you a lot of material to start with, by providing partially implemented ADTs:</p><ul><li>List.cc, List.h: These files have List and Iterator ADT defined.</li><li>TreeNode.cc, TreeNode.h: These files define the TreeNode ADT, which is similar to the material on Trees in Lecture Topic 10.</li><li>Frequency.cc, Frequency.h: These files define an ADT to store a character and an integer.</li><li>FrequencyList.cc, FrequencyList.h: These files define an ADT wrapper for Lists, with two special operations that you have to define.</li><li>Huffman.cc, Huffman.h: These files define two new ADTs: The HUffmanTree, and the HuffmanCodec. These are explained in more detail below.</li></ul><p>For consistency, all of the ADT implementation files have the extension “.cc” so you can recognize them.</p><p>You should find List.cc and TreeNode.cc familiar, as you’ve seen variations of it in previous lectures and assignments. We have made a few simple exercises using Lists and TreeNodes to get started, but most of the List and TreeNode ADT is given. You should review the ADT definitions, to become familiar with the operation names, and to know the details of how the operations are called (i.e., parameters and return values).</p><p>There are some utility files that we provided:</p><ul><li>Element.h, TreeElement.h: These define the data that get stored in our Lists and Trees. You won’t have to change them for this assignment.</li><li>copy.cc, copy.h: These define a useful funciton for making safe copies of C-strings. We’ve used this function several times.</li><li>LOCALE.h: A file with 2 symbols defined. We’ve used #include “LOCALE.h” in all of the other files.</li><li>message.txt: You can use any message file you like, but we’ve provided one that is roughly at the size limit of what the application should be able to do. It’s also topical.</li></ul><p>There are two application files for your use:</p><ul><li>testADTs.cpp: a program that tests almost everything about the ADTs above. There are more than 50 tests, and if they all come back as “Passed” you are almost finished!</li><li>a9app.cpp: This is the application program. Once you have passed all the tests, build this, and see if your work is finished! YOu may make alterations to this file, but you can leave it as given, and the application will run just fine if your ADT operations are working properly.</li></ul><h3 id="Steps-briefly"><a href="#Steps-briefly" class="headerlink" title="Steps (briefly)"></a>Steps (briefly)</h3><p>Each of the following steps is explained more carefully below!</p><ol><li>Download the files, and make sure everything runs right.</li><li>Follow the Exercises in this assignment. The first few are warm-ups, so that you become familiar with the process you should follow. For each exercise:<br>a. Read the exercise.<br>b. Add some code to one or more of the files.<br>c. Build the testADT program, and check if the output shows that your work was successful. The testing in testADT is pretty thorough.</li><li>The final exercise tests your work using the a9app.cc program, which should prove to you that everything is working well.</li></ol><h3 id="Download-all-the-files-and-build"><a href="#Download-all-the-files-and-build" class="headerlink" title="Download all the files and build"></a>Download all the files and build</h3><p>Moodle has the complete set of files.

We recommend that you play the game to gain an overall understanding of how it works.</p><p>In each game, mines are hidden in a two dimensional mine field and the object of the game is to uncover the empty cells and flag the cells containing mines. To simplify your implementation, regions without mines should not be automatically expanded and players are not allowed to unflag cells once they have been flagged. Each game will contain a total of 10 mines, regardless of the grid size.</p><p>You are encouraged to ask questions on Ed using the assignments category. As with any assignment,<br>make sure that your work is your own, and you do not share your code or solutions with other students.</p><h3 id="Working-on-your-assignment"><a href="#Working-on-your-assignment" class="headerlink" title="Working on your assignment"></a>Working on your assignment</h3><p>You can work on this assignment on your own computer or the lab machines.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="1-Aim"><a href="#1-Aim" class="headerlink" title="1. Aim"></a>1. Aim</h3><p>The purpose of this assignment is to:</p><ol><li>Practice basic object-orient programming.</li><li>Read a UML diagram and build the corresponding class.</li><li>Create a class file that includes instance variables and methods necessary to interact with objects of the class.</li></ol><p>It is recommended that you read and understand all the instructions below before starting the exercises.</p><h3 id="2-Files-Needed"><a href="#2-Files-Needed" class="headerlink" title="2. Files Needed"></a>2. Files Needed</h3><p>You will not be provided with any starter files for this assignment. Create a project in Eclipse for this assignment. For this assignment, you will not want Eclipse to create the public static void main method for you. Be sure to include the standard header comments at the top of each file.</p><h3 id="3-To-be-Handed-In"><a href="#3-To-be-Handed-In" class="headerlink" title="3. To be Handed In"></a>3. To be Handed In</h3><p>The files Gate.java should be submitted on-line via the Blackboard. Be sure to name the file/class exactly as specified. There is no MPL component for this assignment.</p><h3 id="4-Programming-Exercise"><a href="#4-Programming-Exercise" class="headerlink" title="4. Programming Exercise"></a>4. Programming Exercise</h3><p>Create a Gate class that can be used to represent a gate for a livestock pen. The members of the Gate class are listed in the diagram below. You must use the same field names and method names (and class constant names) as listed in the diagram. This will insure that the included test program will work for your implemented class.</p><h4 id="Step-1-create-the-Gate-class"><a href="#Step-1-create-the-Gate-class" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: create the Gate class"></a>Step 1: create the Gate class</h4><p>In your Eclipse project for this assignment, create a new class called Gate. Do not indicate that you want Eclipse to create a main method for you.</p><h4 id="Step-2-add-the-instance-variables-and-class-constants"><a href="#Step-2-add-the-instance-variables-and-class-constants" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: add the instance variables and class constants"></a>Step 2: add the instance variables and class constants</h4><p>There will be two states for this gate, locked, which would be a boolean variable, and swingDirection, which we will create as an int. The field swingDirection will indicate which direction the gate is able to swing. To make our program more readable, create two integer class constants (public static final int) to indicate the swing direction:</p><blockquote><p>IN = 1 (to swing in, i.e., to let animals enter the pen)<br>OUT = -1 (to swing out, i.e., to let animals leave the pen)</p></blockquote><p>Be sure to use these class constants as much as possible in your class. When a gate is first constructed, it should be locked and the swing direction should be set to 0, the default value.</p><h4 id="Step-3-add-the-methods"><a href="#Step-3-add-the-methods" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: add the methods"></a>Step 3: add the methods</h4><ol><li><p>Create mutator methods that will change the state of a Gate object.<br>a. close() – to close the gate by “locking” it (i.e., locked is true),<br>b. open() – to (i) open the gate by “unlocking” it (i.e., locked is false), (ii) set the swing direction to either swing in or out (i.e., swingDirection is either IN or OUT based on the input parameter), and (iii) return a boolean value indicating if the setting of the swing direction was successful (see the next point),<br>c. setSwingDirection() – to (i) set the swing direction of the gate based on the input parameter and (ii) return a boolean value to indicate if the setting the swing direction was successfully set (true), or if an invalid swing direction was given (false, not set), and<br>d. thru() – described in No. 3 below.</p></li><li><p>Create accessor methods that will return information about the state of a Gate object.<br>a. getSwingDirection() – returns the swing direction of the gate,<br>b. isLocked() – returns whether the gate is locked, and<br>c. toString() – returns the string representation of the Gate object that should match the output of the provided example execution of the test program.</p></li><li><p>Another behavior of the gate is that animals will go through it. Suppose n animals attempt to go through the gate. If the gate is set to the swing OUT position, the animals will leave the pen and the total number of animals in the pen will be decreased. If the gate is set to the swing IN position, animals will be entering the pen and the number of animals will be increased. If the gate is locked, there should be no change to the number of animals in the pen. Create a method thru() that given the input parameter n, will return n, -n, or 0 depending on the locked status and the swing direction of the gate. Note: the class you are writing only represents a gate and not a pen. Here you should be thinking like the author of the class—making your class as useful and general as possible. Instead of attempting to alter some total that is in or out of the facility that the gate is controlling, we are simply going to return the net change, to be used by the client as needed.</p></li></ol><h4 id="Step-4-write-Javadoc-comments"><a href="#Step-4-write-Javadoc-comments" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: write Javadoc comments"></a>Step 4: write Javadoc comments</h4><p>Now that you have completed the Gate class, make sure you document it by adding Javadoc comments. First, add the standard comment header (see section 2 above) at the top of the file. Then add a Javadoc comment just before the class itself, describing the purpose of the class. Then add a Javadoc comment for each method, describing what that method does.</p><p>Example execution of TestGate.java<br><figure class="highlight subunit"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Test </span>locked status of gate upon creation ===============================</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>A new gate was successfully created.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Test </span>opening gate to OUT ===============================================</span><br><span class="line">Gate opened.</span><br><span class="line">- SUCCESS: Gate not locked.</span><br><span class="line">- SUCCESS: Gate set to swing in the right direction.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Test </span>opening gate to IN ================================================</span><br><span class="line">Gate opened.</span><br><span class="line">- SUCCESS: Gate not locked.</span><br><span class="line">- SUCCESS: Gate set to swing in the right direction.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Test </span>closing gate ======================================================</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Gate closed.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Test </span>setting of swing direction ========================================</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Gate set to swing IN.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Gate set to swing OUT.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Gate swing direction was not set to an invalid direction.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Gate swing direction was set to a valid direction.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Test </span>thru() method =====================================================</span><br><span class="line">Current count = 10</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Animals have successfully left the pen.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>Animals have successfully entered the pen.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SUCCESS: </span>This gate is locked, no animals can pass through.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">toString() method output ===============================================</span><br><span class="line">Locked: Yes</span><br><span class="line">Swing direction: In</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Problam-Statement"><a href="#Problam-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Problam Statement"></a>Problam Statement</h3><p>Over our next two assignments, we shall build our own version of the game Mario. Well, a simple TUI version. TUI means Text-based User Interface or Textual User Interface as opposed to GUI, which stands for Graphical User Interface.</p><p>The goal of our Assignment 4 is to set up our game, i.e., set up the maze Mario is meant to travel through. This maze will contain obstacles, Mario himself and an exit gate. The goal of our Assignment 5 will be to allow the user to play our game by moving Mario around the maze.</p><p>Let’s start with Assignment 4, shall we. In order to develop our Assignment 4 in an incremental fashion, I propose the following scheme: considering the algorithm below, let’s develop, test and debug each of its steps, one at a time, and move on to the next step only when the step we have been working on is completed. Here is our algorithm:</p><ol><li>Welcome the user.</li><li>Create a maze with a width of mazeWidth and a height of mazeHeight.<ol><li>a. Assign the value 15 to the variable mazeWidth and the value 12 to the variable mazeHeight. Note that the values of these two variables will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that modifying the values of these variables can be done easily.</li><li>b. Originally, each cell must contain this string “ . “. Note that the content of our cells will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change the content of our cells.<br>Display a boundary around our maze.</li><li>a. Originally, we must use the “-“ symbol to create the top and the bottom parts of the boundary around our maze. Note that this symbol will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this symbol.</li><li>b. Originally, we must use the “|” symbol to create the side sections of the boundary around our maze. Note that this symbol will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this symbol. The side sections of the boundary may be tricky to construct! Suggestion: One way to build them is to create a string for each of the row of our maze. This string will contain blank spaces, a number (see 4. b. below), 2 symbols indicating a side section of the boundary and the actual row of our maze.</li><li>c. This boundary is not part of our maze, it is outside our maze.</li></ol></li><li>At the top and left of the boundary, display numbers. These numbers will help the user to select a cell in our maze.<br>a. To produce the top row of numbers, we can build and print a string that will be made of blank spaces and numbers.<br>b. To produce the left-side column of numbers may be tricky! See the suggestion described in 3. b. above.<br>Add aNumOfRewardingObstacles of rewarding obstacles to our maze.<br>a. Assign the value 20 to aNumOfRewardingObstacles. Note that this number will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this number.<br>b. Originally, we must use the symbol “R” to indicate that a cell of our maze contains a rewarding obstacle. Note that this symbol will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this symbol.<br>c. All these obstacles must be randomly located in our maze.<br>d. We cannot position more than 1 obstacle (of any types) in a cell.</li><li>Add aNumOfExplodingObstacles of exploding obstacles to our maze.<br>a. Assign the value 20 to aNumOfExplodingObstacles. Note that this number will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this number.<br>b. Originally, we must use the symbol “E” to indicate that a cell of our maze contains an exploding obstacle. Note that this symbol will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this symbol.<br>c. All these obstacles must be randomly located in our maze.<br>d. We cannot position more than 1 obstacle (of any types) in a cell.</li><li>Ask the user for Mario’s initial location in the maze.<br>a. Let’s make sure that the user has entered a location that makes sense:<br>i. The user has entered 2 integers separated by a blank space. The user has<br>1) not simply pressed the Enter key, or<br>2) entered a string, or<br>3) entered 1 integer or 1 float, or<br>4) entered 2 numbers of which one or both are floats, or<br>5) entered more than 2 integers or floats.<br>ii. The row number entered by the user does not exceed the maximum number of rows of our maze.<br>iii. The column number entered by the user does not exceed the maximum number of columns of our maze.<br>iv. Finally, the user has entered the row number and column number of an empty cell.<br>b. Add Mario at that location. Originally, we must use the symbol “M” to indicate the location of Mario in our maze. Note that this symbol will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this symbol.</li><li>The Sample Run 1, posted on our course web site below the description of this assignment, illustrates how the program responds to the user when s/he has entered invalid data described in the step (7.) above.<br>Based on Mario’s location, our program is to place the exit gate on the top or bottom part of our boundary according to the following rule:<br>a. Imagine we divide our maze into 4 quadrants: top right, top left, bottom right, bottom left.<br>i. If the user has placed Mario in the top right quadrant, then our program positions the exit gate on the bottom section of the boundary to the left of the median (imaginary vertical line dividing our maze in two).<br>ii. If the user has placed Mario in the top left quadrant, then our program positions the exit gate on the bottom section of the boundary to the right of the median.<br>iii. If the user has placed Mario in the bottom right quadrant, then our program positions the exit gate on the top section of the boundary to the left of the median.<br>iv. If the user has placed Mario in the bottom left quadrant, then our program positions the exit gate on the top section of the boundary to the right of the median.<br>b. Originally, we must use the symbol “=” to indicate the exit gate on the top or bottom part of the boundary of our maze. Note that this symbol will change, so let’s make sure we develop our program such that we can easily change this symbol.</li><li>The code we create for Assignment 4 must produce exactly the same output as the one shown in the images included above and the Sample Runs. Of course, the position of our obstacles (both types), of Mario and of the exit gate will be different but everything else must be the same.</li></ol><h3 id="Caution"><a href="#Caution" class="headerlink" title="Caution"></a>Caution</h3><p>Remember that indices of list elements start at 0, while the numbers displayed above and to the left of our maze start at 1. Therefore, when the user selects the cell in which Mario is to be placed on our maze, once we read these two numbers (the row and column numbers), we may have to decrement them by 1 in order to use these numbers as indices.</p><h3 id="Marking"><a href="#Marking" class="headerlink" title="Marking"></a>Marking</h3><p>When marking Assignment 4, we will look at how well our solution satisfies the description and requirements of this assignment as described in the problem Statement section above as well as the criteria listed here:</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem"></a>Problem</h3><p>You will implement additional features to a simple “Rogue-like” computer game that was described in the CIS 2500: Assignment 2 Specification (further referred to as A2 Spec). You are encouraged to reuse your code from Assignment 2, but don’t be afraid to rewrite portions of it.</p><p>It is assumed that the program described by this specification also follows the A2 Spec. In the event a requirement described in this document directly conflicts with another described in the A2 Spec, the requirement in this document is to be followed.</p><h3 id="Description"><a href="#Description" class="headerlink" title="Description"></a>Description</h3><p>Your program must implement all features described in the A2 Spec, in addition to the following:</p><ol><li>Status bar and notifications</li><li>Hallways</li><li>Inventory, item stats, and item use</li><li>Player and enemy stats</li><li>Combat</li></ol><p>Refer to the following sections for the definition of each feature. As previously stated: In the event a requirement described in this document directly conflicts with another described in the A2 Spec, the requirement in this document is to be followed.</p><h3 id="Status-bar-and-notifications"><a href="#Status-bar-and-notifications" class="headerlink" title="Status bar and notifications"></a>Status bar and notifications</h3><p>During level loading, your program should reserve a blank line at the top and bottom of the screen. The program will use the top line for notifications, and the bottom line as a status bar.</p><p>The notification bar will be responsible for printing messages for the user. A message should be printed in this bar after an event occurs. Messages should automatically be cleared every time the player presses a key. The following tables document events, when they occur, and what message should be displayed.</p><p>The status bar will be responsible for displaying the hero’s health, potion count, attack, and inventory count. This information should be displayed at all times, and get updated each time the player presses a key. It should be formatted as follows:<br><figure class="highlight accesslog"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Health: <span class="string">[A]</span>, Potions: <span class="string">[B]</span>, Attack: <span class="string">[C]</span>, Inv: <span class="string">[D]</span>/<span class="number">5</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Where:<br>[A] is the hero’s current health</p><p>[B] is the hero’s current potion count</p><p>[C] is the hero’s current attack rating</p><p>[D] is the number of items in the hero’s inventory, excluding potions. The value has a maximum of 5.</p><h3 id="Hallways"><a href="#Hallways" class="headerlink" title="Hallways"></a>Hallways</h3><p>Your program should no longer teleport the hero when they step on a door. Instead, the hero will open the door, triggering a Door event, and be able to use Hallways to traverse the level.<br>During game initialization, before, during, or after your program draws rooms to the screen it should also draw hallways. Hallways, denoted by the symbol #, can be walked on by the hero. They should be drawn extending from doors, and should be generated in a manner that ensures every room is accessible by the hero through at least one path. Every door must have a hallway.<br>Notes:</p><ul><li>You can wrap hallways around the screen (similar to pacman mazes), if you want.</li><li>Hallways can connect to other hallways.</li><li>Hallways can have deadends, as long as there is some path that leads to every room.</li><li>It’s easiest to map each door to its closest adjacent room.</li><li>You can assume every room will have at least one door. You cannot assume the location of that door.</li><li>Don’t forget to leave room for hallways when you draw your rooms, including the top and bottom edges of the terminal.</li></ul><h3 id="Inventory-item-stats-and-item-use"><a href="#Inventory-item-stats-and-item-use" class="headerlink" title="Inventory, item stats, and item use"></a>Inventory, item stats, and item use</h3><p>Your program should keep track of items that the hero picks up during the game, and print out the players inventory at the end of the game underneath their gold. This print out should include the items stat. The stat should be randomly generated when parsing the level file, and fall within the specified range. The following is a list of items that can be added to the hero’s inventory.</p><p>The hero can have a maximum of 5 items in their inventory. In a case where a hero has 5 items in their inventory, and steps on an item that can be added to their inventory, a BagFull event should occur, and the item should be removed from the screen without it being added to the hero’s inventory.</p><p>Potions and gold can always be picked up by the hero, and should be added to the potion count and gold count respectively, instead of the inventory. When the game starts, the hero should start with 1 potion, and 0 gold.</p><p>Your program should now allow the player to use potions. Figure 1 describes the activity that should occur when the p key is pressed.</p><figure class="highlight sqf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Aquator: No cycles.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem"></a>Problem</h3><p>You will implement the basic features of a “Rogue-like” computer game. Your program will accept an input file describing the layout of a single level with 6 rooms in it, and your program should draw all six rooms in a single window. Your program will also have a hero that the user can control, and move around the level.</p><h3 id="Description"><a href="#Description" class="headerlink" title="Description"></a>Description</h3><p>When started, your program should accept one command line argument (using argc and argv). The command line argument is a path to the level file. This file is a description of the level to be drawn.</p><p>Your program should start by opening the file, parsing the room descriptions line by line, and storing the data in an appropriate struct. Once done, close the file.</p><p>The program should then initialize ncurses, draw the level to the screen, and enter a “game loop”. While in the game loop, your program should accept input from the user to manipulate the world and update the screen appropriately. If the user presses the quit key, your program should exit the game loop, clean up ncurses, print the player’s amount of gold and return.<br>While in the game loop, the user is able to move the hero around the level. If the hero steps on a door, they should be teleported. Stepping on a door in room 1, should teleport the hero to a door in room 2. Stepping on a door in room 2, should teleport the hero to a door in room 3. Room 4 doors teleport the hero to room 5 doors. Room 5 doors teleport the hero to room 6 doors. And room 6 doors teleport the hero to room 1 doors. See Figure 1 for room numbering.</p><h3 id="Additional-Notes"><a href="#Additional-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Additional Notes"></a>Additional Notes</h3><ol><li>The hero should be unable to step on walls, and should therefore be unable to walk outside of rooms.</li><li>The hero should be unable to walk on weak monsters or strong monsters.</li><li>If the hero steps on a small gold or big gold, the value of that gold piece should be added to the hero’s gold amount. The hero starts with 0 gold.</li><li>If the hero steps on a collectable, it should be removed from the screen. The following elements are collectable: Small gold, Big gold, Common weapon, Rare weapon, Equipment, Potion.</li><li>If the hero steps on stairs going up or down, the program should execute the normal quitting procedure.</li></ol><h3 id="Level-File"><a href="#Level-File" class="headerlink" title="Level File"></a>Level File</h3><ul><li>The input file will contain 6 rooms. You are expected to draw the rooms 3 across and 2 down. No room will be larger than 18 rows X 23 columns.</li><li>Each line of the file will consist of a space-delimited line of text.</li><li>Each line of the file will be less than 150 characters.</li><li>No room will have more than 10 elements (excluding room dimensions, and doors).</li><li>Lines will always have a newline at the end.</li><li>The first element of the input string will ALWAYS be the room dimensions given as rowsXcolumns (i.e. 10X12). The dimensions given are the dimensions of the floor of the room. The walls must surround the floor.</li><li>Following the room dimensions are room elements. These elements can be in any order.</li><li>Door elements will begin with a lowercase d followed by a letter representing the wall that the door is in. For example, de3 is a door in the east wall in position three from the north edge (where the floor corner is position 0, and walls start at 1). There will never be more than one door per wall.</li><li>All other (not room dimension or door) elements will begin with a lowercase letter followed by coordinates. For example: w6,8 means there is a weapon at row 6 column 8 where the northwest floor corner of the room is 0,0.</li><li>For this assignment, you can assume the file inputted will follow this specification as closely as possible.</li></ul>]]></content>
