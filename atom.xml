The car park can accommodate a total of 45 cars, where each level will have 15 parking spaces. In order to facilitate the management of the car park, and enable students to rent parking spaces, a system is needed to handle the registration of students for each available car park for each semester. A student, once registered may park his or her car at the car park for duration of 120 days. The system would be used by the parking administration office to register students who wishes to park at the car park. The users should be able to insert, update, delete, read the following information about the students, parking spaces as well as user details.</p><h3 id="System-Requirement"><a href="#System-Requirement" class="headerlink" title="System Requirement"></a>System Requirement</h3><ol><li><p>The system must require user to enter his or her ID and an assigned password before using the system.

A menu consists of up to 50 items, each of which has a name, description, and price. You will implement a class called Menu to store the menu. A driver class will be used to interact with a Menu (add/remove items, change name/description/price, etc.) and build up an “order” of items from the menu (like a shopping cart).</p><p>Write a fully-documented class named MenuItem which contains the item’s name (String), description (String), and price (double). You should provide accessor and mutator methods for each variable, as well as a constructor for the class. The mutator method for the price variable should throw an exception if the new price is nonpositive.</p><p>Write a fully-documented class named Menu which stores a list of items in an array and provides an interface to interact with this list. Note that although arrays in Java are indexed starting with 0, the items in a Menu will be indexed starting with 1. A Menu can hold up to 50 items at a time, so use the final variable MAX_ITEMS = 50. The class will be based on the following ADT specification:</p><h4 id="public-class-Menu"><a href="#public-class-Menu" class="headerlink" title="public class Menu"></a>public class Menu</h4><p>The Menu class implements an abstract data type for a list of menu items supporting some common operations on such lists.<br>Constructor for Menu<br><figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">public Menu()</span><br><span class="line">Construct an<span class="built_in"> instance </span>of the Menu class with <span class="literal">no</span> MenuItem objects <span class="keyword">in</span> it.</span><br><span class="line">Postcondition:</span><br><span class="line">This Menu has been initialized <span class="keyword">to</span> an empty list of MenuItems.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>clone<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">public Object clone()</span><br><span class="line">Generate <span class="keyword">a</span> copy <span class="keyword">of</span> this Menu.</span><br><span class="line">Returns: </span><br><span class="line">The <span class="literal">return</span> <span class="built_in">value</span> is <span class="keyword">a</span> copy <span class="keyword">of</span> this Menu.

Questions 3 and 4 can use any form of recursion.</p><h3 id="Q1"><a href="#Q1" class="headerlink" title="Q1"></a>Q1</h3><p>In the game Racko, players attempt to build a strictly increasing sequence of cards (in which a number is less than the number that comes after it). At the end of the game, five points are awarded for each number in the increasing sequence that starts with the first card in the list. Note that any further increasing sequences in the list do not earn any points. For example, there are 20 points awarded for the values 5,10,12,16,15,43, because it begins with the strictly increasing sequence 5,10,12,16.<br>Use accumulative recursion to complete the Python function racko_points, that consumes seq, a list of distinct integers between 1 and 60, inclusive, and produces the score for seq.<br>For example,<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">racko_points([]) =&gt; <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">racko_points([<span class="number">9</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">40</span>,<span class="number">60</span>]) =&gt; <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line">racko_points([<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">10</span>,<span class="number">48</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">9</span>,<span class="number">17</span>,<span class="number">40</span>,<span class="number">60</span>]) =&gt; <span class="number">15</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Note that you cannot reorder seq. Determine the number of earned points for the seq in the order given.</p><h3 id="Q2"><a href="#Q2" class="headerlink" title="Q2"></a>Q2</h3><p>Consider Xtreme Racko, a variation of Racko® (as described in Question 1) that allows a player to score points for each number in their longest increasing sequence, regardless of where that sequence begins. Use accumulative recursion to complete the Python function xtreme_racko_points, that consumes seq, a list of distinct numbers between 1 and 60, inclusive, and produces the score for seq.<br>For example,<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">xtreme_racko_points([]) =&gt; <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">xtreme_racko_points([<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">22</span>,<span class="number">40</span>,<span class="number">60</span>]) =&gt; <span class="number">20</span></span><br><span class="line">xtreme_racko_points([<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">50</span>,<span class="number">46</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">9</span>,<span class="number">17</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">60</span>]) =&gt; <span class="number">15</span></span><br><span class="line">xtreme_racko_points([<span class="number">60</span>,<span class="number">50</span>,<span class="number">40</span>,<span class="number">30</span>]) =&gt; <span class="number">5</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><blockquote><p>Hint: You may find it helpful to use more than one accumulator for this question.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Q3"><a href="#Q3" class="headerlink" title="Q3"></a>Q3</h3><p>Write a Python function histogram that consumes marks, a list of integer marks between 0 and 100,</p><p>inclusive. The function produces None, and prints a histogram for marks. The histogram consists of one row for each distinct mark. The i th row has the form:</p><p>vvv: row where vvv is the i th smallest value (right justified over 3 places) and row is a string containing k copies of the string ‘X’, where k is the number of times vvv occurs in marks. That is, the first row contains information about the smallest value in marks, the second row contains information about the second smalles distinct value in marks, and so on. The consumed list may not be mutated. If marks is empty, nothing is printed.</p><p>For example, calling histogram([77,78,77,90,0,88,84,83,88,88,77,76,92,100,100]) prints<br><figure class="highlight http"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">0</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">76</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">77</span>: XXX</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">78</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">83</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">84</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">88</span>: XXX</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">90</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">92</span>: X</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">100</span>: XX</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The mark before the ‘:’ can be right justified using the rjust string method. There must be exactly one space after the colon, and no spaces after the string of ‘X’ values.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Program-Specification"><a href="#Program-Specification" class="headerlink" title="Program Specification"></a>Program Specification</h3><p>In this program you will simulate a simple, one-dimensional cellular automaton. You will implement it using a list, where each element of the list represents 1 cell. Each cell has a state (or value) of dead or alive. You can represent these two states however you’d like (0/1, True/False or any other pairs of data).</p><p>What will this automaton do? It changes. I will refer to a change in the automaton as one step. In one step, all the cells have an opportunity to change (some will, some won’t). Going from left to right in the automaton, the new state of a cell is based on the old state of that current cell and based on the old state of the cells to the left and right.<br>Here are the rules:</p><ul><li>The new state of cell[j] will be alive If the old states of cell[j-1], cell[j], and cell[j+1] were all the same (either all alive or all dead),</li><li>Otherwise, the new state of cell[j] will be dead.</li></ul><p>Consequently, your program has to keep track of old states and new states while the automaton is going through one step. Remember, even though you’ve determined the new state of cell[j], the program still needs to know its old state when it becomes the neighbor of the next cell over.</p><p>What about the edge cells: cell[0] and cell[len(cell) - 1]? If we need to check the cell to the left and right that means using indices that are beyond the boundary of the list! Our solution is for your algorithm to assume that there are neighbors there, and that they are always dead. You should not store these values in the list (in otherwords, don’t make your list length 2 larger than it needs to be). Instead, your algorithm should handle these end cells separately.</p><p>Here is an example with a 6 cell automaton and running 4 steps. I’m going to use D for dead and A for alive so it’s easier to see. This automaton initially has all ALIVE cells:</p><figure class="highlight mipsasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">AAAAAA <span class="comment"># initial state</span></span><br><span class="line">DAAAAD <span class="comment"># after step 1.

Make sure you understand why the ends became alive.</span></span><br><span class="line">DDAADD <span class="comment"># after step 4</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><blockquote><p>REQUIREMENT: The only list method you may use for this assignment is .append() Do not use any other list library methods to solve this problem. Do not turn the list into a string or other data type either. I want you to work with a list object and come up with all the algorithms yourself.</p></blockquote><h3 id="User-Input"><a href="#User-Input" class="headerlink" title="User Input"></a>User Input</h3><p>There are 2 pieces of information that your program needs from the user:</p><ol><li>The name of the file with the starting values of the automaton. You can read more about the file format below.</li><li>The number of steps to run. This must be a positive value.<br>Your program must handle invalid input for both of these: filename for a file that doesn’t exist; a non-positive number as well as an invalid type. If either input is invalid, display a helpful error message and prompt again.</li></ol><h3 id="Display"><a href="#Display" class="headerlink" title="Display"></a>Display</h3><p>For increased readability, if a cell’s state is alive, print the ‘+’ character. If a cell’s state is dead, print the space character, ‘ ‘. Print only these characters; don’t just call the print() function on the list. The program should not display commas or the surrounding list brackets [ ]. Also, do not print any blank lines between the displays. Print nothing else on the lines besides the state of the automaton. Print one complete step per line.</p><p>I recommend you change the font used by IDLE so these 2 characters have the same width:</p><ol><li>Under the Options Menu, choose Configure IDLE (on the MAC,choose Preferences under the IDLE menu)</li><li>Choose a font such as Courier New, Lucida Console, or Lucida Sans Typewriter (fixed-width fonts). This will change the font in both the shell window and the editor window.</li><li>You may also want to select bold so that the display patterns are easy to see.</li></ol><h3 id="File-Format"><a href="#File-Format" class="headerlink" title="File Format"></a>File Format</h3><p>The text file will contain 4 lines. The first 3 lines will have either the word alive or dead, specifying a pattern. The 4th line is an integer, indicating how many times to repeat this pattern. For example:<br><figure class="highlight sqf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">ALIVE</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">ALIVE</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">ALIVE</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">20</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Your program needs to read this data in and use it to intialize the automaton. For example, based on this file, the automaton will have a length of 60 cells.</p><p>You can use this example to create a text file, or create your own pattern.</p><h3 id="Documentation-and-Other-Style-Issues"><a href="#Documentation-and-Other-Style-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Documentation and Other Style Issues"></a>Documentation and Other Style Issues</h3><p>You should follow all of the commenting guidelines covered in the commenting guidelines.</p><h3 id="Written-Report"><a href="#Written-Report" class="headerlink" title="Written Report"></a>Written Report</h3><p>Please type up the answers to the following questions and include as a comment at the bottom of your .py file:</p><ol><li>How did you go about starting this assignment?</li><li>During development, where did you get stuck, if at all, and how did you get unstuck?</li><li>How did you test your program? Does your program meet the homework specification? If not, in what ways does it fall short?</li><li>What did you learn from this assignment?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>In this assignment you are going to use a Java toolkit for use in traffic engineering applications. As well as writing some code yourself, you will also modify or use code written by others. Like all good Java software, the various classes you write may be used by a variety of clients such as graphical simulation software packages for modelling traffic flows under various conditions or by the software that controls the city’s network of traffic lights.</p><p>There’s quite a lot of reading here — don’t be discouraged! Once you have a good understanding of the way the various aspects of the topic fit together, you will find writing your part a lot easier. We’ll be releasing material in several parts: the focus of this part is domain knowledge and analysis — no Java coding is involved.</p><p>This assignment is not just a programming exercise: it is an opportunity for you to demonstrate a range of software engineering skills. These might include analysis, modelling, design, testing and documentation as well as coding. It is typical in software engineering projects for the domain to be one you may not be expert in, and for requirements to be vague, incomplete or contradictory — we’ll also exercise our communication skills!</p><h3 id="How-intersections-work"><a href="#How-intersections-work" class="headerlink" title="How intersections work"></a>How intersections work</h3><h4 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h4><p>We all spend a considerable part of our lives travelling on our country’s roads. As city dwellers 1 , most of us spend much of our travelling time at intersections. As you complete this assignment, you will get to think more deeply about intersections and learn a little 2 about how they are controlled. We hope your future journeys will be much more interesting as a result.</p><p>To begin with, we need to gather some terminology and definitions. Intersections — places where roads meet or cross — come in many different shapes and sizes (geometries). Figure 1 on the following page shows the two most common geometries — the familiar ‘T’ and ‘+’ intersections.</p><p>There are many variations on these basic geometries. The roads may not meet at right angles or there may be more than two intersecting roads.</p><p>The simplest kind of intersections are uncontrolled and vehicles move through the intersection in accordance with the basic road rules governing right of way. Uncontrolled intersections are now quite rare in urban areas and are only suitable for low traffic volume locations. The next level of sophistication involves the use of signs to reinforce the rules (as on an intersection with Give Way signs at all approaches) or to override them (as in the case of Stop signs on a minor road where it joins a major one).</p><p>Other options include the use of roundabouts (also known as traffic islands or rotary intersections) and “free turn” lanes to increase traffic flow while relying on basic road rules. We will not consider these further in this assignment.</p><p>We will only be considering controlled intersections where electronic signalling devices — traffic lights — are used to enforce a plan for giving the right of way in turn to vehicles approaching the intersection from different directions.</p><h4 id="Traffic-streams"><a href="#Traffic-streams" class="headerlink" title="Traffic streams"></a>Traffic streams</h4><p>We can describe what happens at an intersection in terms of a number of traffic streams. The traffic approaching an intersection along a particular road may be regarded conceptually as being made up of several separate streams. Whenever we approach an intersection we have (usually!) already selected a traffic stream that fits our intended movement. Examples might be “I’m in the right turn lane” or “I’m in the straight ahead or left turn lane”. Figure 2 on the next page shows six common streams seen at intersections — see how many you can spot on your way home. These 6 streams are for traffic approaching from one particular direction. The streams for traffic approaching from other directions are simply those shown in Figure 2 on the following page rotated by the appropriate amount.</p><p>Many streets are divided into a number of parallel lanes by road markings and sometimes physical features such as median strips. Lane markings are usually designed so that they correspond to particular traffic streams (e.g. north-bound through traffic AND west-bound left turning traffic). Detectors embedded in the road are unable to tell whether vehicles are intending to continue straight through or make turns. In this case the stream is regarded as consisting of the combination of the possible options. Detectors are considered further in later sections.</p><p>For example, traffic approaching the intersection of Hoare Street and Dahl Drive from the south (see Figure 1) could consist of up to three traffic streams: through traffic continuing north on Dahl Drive, left-turning traffic continuing west on Hoare Street and right-turning traffic continuing east on Hoare Street. These could be accommodated in different ways depending on the number of lanes available at the intersection: by having three separate traffic streams (types (a), (b) and (c) in Figure 2 on the next page); by having two traffic streams (types (c) and (d)) or (types (b) and (e)); by having one traffic stream (type (f)).</p><p>Sometimes particular potential traffic streams are not available — such as a turn onto a one-way street or continuing straight ahead at a ‘T’ junction — at an intersection.</p><h4 id="Traffic-lights"><a href="#Traffic-lights" class="headerlink" title="Traffic lights"></a>Traffic lights</h4><p>At a controlled intersection, there are a number of signal heads mounted on poles or suspended above the roadway. Each signal head has a number of signal faces, each consisting of a number of individual lights. Each light has a single colour and may be on or off 3 . The lights are arranged in groups. For simplicity, we will assume that these are always groups of three, in practice other configurations (such as a single green right turn arrow light) occur. Some examples are shown in Figure 3.</p><p>The most common signal face configuration consists of red, amber &amp; green circular lights controlled so that only one member of the group is on at any time (e.g. when the green light is on, the yellow and red lights in the same group are off). Another very common configuration is a group of three (red, amber and green) arrow lights: these are usually controlled so that at most one light is on at any time.</p><p>Variations include through arrows in red, amber &amp; green as well as bus, tram, pedestrian and cycle lane signals.</p><p>Each signal face is positioned so that is is clearly visible to approaching vehicles in the relevant traffic stream(s). Each traffic stream may have several signal faces. Three is the usual number — check for yourself! Figure 1 on the preceding page shows the signal faces visible to the south-bound traffic streams approaching the intersection of Dahl Drive and Hoare Street from the north.</p><p>Each face has a location relative to the intersection centre and an orientation indicating the direction it is facing. The locations of the signal faces in Figure 1 on the previous page are NE, SW and SE. All faces for a particular stream will usually face the same direction — all three face north in this case.</p><p>Signal faces can be shared between traffic streams. In practice, a “through and left” stream (type (d) in Figure 2) and a “through and right” stream (type (e)) would probably share a signal face for controlling through traffic movement. Figure 3(b) shows a signal face which can control types (c), (d) and (f) depending on the states of the round lights ((green, yellow or red) and right arrow (green, yellow, red, off).</p><h4 id="Phases-amp-phase-plans"><a href="#Phases-amp-phase-plans" class="headerlink" title="Phases &amp; phase plans"></a>Phases &amp; phase plans</h4><p>Each controlled intersection has a cycle consisting of a number of phases. The intersection has a phase plan which specifies the order of the individual phases. Each phase is carried out in turn until the cycle is complete, at which time the cycle then begins again. You may have noticed that some intersections may have more than one phase plan. For example, a “rush hour” plan might include protected right turns and shorter phases while an “off peak” plan might omit protected turns and have longer phases.</p><p>In any particular phase the intersection’s lights are switched into a pattern allowing one or more traffic streams to proceed (by giving them green lights) and preventing others from moving (by giving them red lights). For example, one phase might permit both north-bound and south-bound through traffic on Dahl Drive; another might permit north-bound and south- bound through traffic on Dahl Drive as well as left-turning traffic onto Hoare Street.</p><p>Figure 4 on the next page shows one possible cycle for the intersection of Dahl Drive and Hoare Street. The cycle consists of four phases. Each phase involves two traffic streams from the basic set shown in Figure 2 on the preceding page.</p><ol><li>The appropriate combination of red and green lights is set to permit north-bound and south-bound through traffic on Dahl Drive as well as left turns onto Hoare Street. No right turns are allowed in this phase. No traffic on Hoare Street is permitted to move in this phase.</li><li>Now the appropriate lights are changed to stop the north and south bound through traffic and traffic turning left onto Hoare Street. In addition, further light changes permit right turns from Dahl Drive onto Hoare Street. Traffic on Hoare Street is still not permitted to move in this phase.</li><li>Now it is the turn of the traffic which has been waiting on Hoare Street. The appropriate lights are changed to prevent right turns onto Hoare Street and to prevent any traffic on Dahl Drive from moving. East-bound and west-bound traffic on Hoare Street is permitted as well as left turns onto Dahl Drive.</li><li>Finally, all streams are stopped except for cycle length, is fixed in advance. The phase right turns from Hoare Street onto Dahl plan may depend on factors such as time Drive.</li></ol><p>At the end of phase 4 the cycle begins again.</p><p>Four-phase intersections are quite common — see how many can you spot on your way home. A 2-phase intersection has a very simple plan but you may also encounter many more complex phase plans.</p><p>Now let’s consider the details of the light changing process as one phase ends and another begins. The transition between phases is not immediate — there is a change interval which includes the yellow interval where amber lights are displayed to allow traffic already committed to crossing the intersection to be cleared and an all red interval where red lights are set to prevent any further incoming traffic from the traffic streams active in the phase and to provide a safety margin 4 . Only when the all red interval has elapsed can the next phase be permitted to begin allowing further traffic movement. Typical yellow intervals are 3–4 seconds long and typical all-red intervals are about 1 second. Is this consistent with your observations?</p><p>For simplicity, we will treat change intervals and all-red intervals as separate phases in this assignment.</p><h4 id="Controlling-intersections"><a href="#Controlling-intersections" class="headerlink" title="Controlling intersections"></a>Controlling intersections</h4><p>Many intersections have detectors buried beneath the road surface in order to detect the approach of vehicles in the corresponding lanes (and hence traffic streams). Some cycle lanes also feature detectors. Detectors come in two types. Modern (active) detectors notify the intersection controlling software when a vehicle arrives. The intersection may then decide to switch to a phase which will service the corresponding traffic stream. Older style (passive) detectors record vehicle arrivals but the intersection must poll them to interrogate them about the data they have recorded. Polling involves asking each detector in turn if it has detected any vehicles.</p><p>Controlled intersections can be classified into three major groups according to the way they (via their phase plans) use information provided by detectors.</p><p>The ultimate in sophistication is linking intersections into zones with the same cycle lengths. This enables platoons of vehicles to travel through a sequence of intersections without being stopped. You may have noticed this technique used on the one-way street system around Christchurch.</p><h4 id="A-local-example"><a href="#A-local-example" class="headerlink" title="A local example"></a>A local example</h4><p>Figure 5 shows an example of how we’ll think about intersections. It shows the intersection of Clyde &amp; Creyke Roads with Kotare 5 Street — this is at the north-east corner of the block containing the campus so (as we did) you can observe it for yourself.</p><p>Traffic entering from each direction sees signal faces consisting of 3 round lights. Traffic arriving from the north also sees a signal face consisting of 3 right arrow lights (see Figure 3(b). Overhead lights are ignored, as is the “free turn” for traffic turning left from Creyke Road into Clyde Road.</p><p>The active phase plan consists of seven phases. In the first phase all traffic arriving from the east and west may proceed (i.e. traffic streams of type (f) in Figure 2), with right-turning vehicles giving way as usual, while traffic arriving from the north or south must wait.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>Write a menu driven program for keeping track of tasks. This requires using an array or using an ArrayList object (either one is okay). The main class will be called TaskManager and the list of tasks will be in this class. Each individual task will be an object of the type Task. This is a separate class (in a separate file) which you create. See Task class below for more details.</p><p>If your using the array rather than the ArrayList, you will need to create it to some fixed size. Use 200 and then keep track of how many actual tasks are in the list using a class level in variable (‘listSize’).</p><h3 id="Task-class"><a href="#Task-class" class="headerlink" title="Task class"></a>Task class</h3><p>Tasks have fields of name, description, due date and a list of tags. These are to be created in the Task class. Make them private and then create a set of public methods to access and change the values of them. You will need methods to add or delete a tag. You can create a constructor that takes the name, description and due date values (tags are more difficult as you may have anywhere from 0 to 20 of them so do these using the add tag method) OR you can just use a default (no parameters) constructor and use setter methods to add values to the class.</p><p>The name, description and tags are strings that can have spaces in them. The due date consists of a month, day and year. These can be stored as three int’s OR you can create another class called TaskDate and store them there. The advantage of having a TaskDate class is that you can also put any comparison and print methods for the date in this class.</p><p>Don’t put any methods that require you to work with the entire array inside the Task class. Put these inside the main TaskManager class (along with the array and count). Remember that the Task class only works on the fields of one task, not all tasks.</p><h3 id="Description"><a href="#Description" class="headerlink" title="Description"></a>Description</h3><p>The following methods should be in your main class:</p><h4 id="addTask"><a href="#addTask" class="headerlink" title="addTask"></a>addTask</h4><p>Asks the user for the name, description and due date (ask for month, day and year) and any number of tags (up to 20 if your using an array for tags). Then create a Task object and put it into the array (or ArrayList). Check to make sure the task’s name has not already been used as you will be using the name to distinguish between tasks. If there is a duplicate, allow the user to re­enter a name. So in the main class you should have a separate findTask method that takes a task name and passes back either the Task object or an index into the array of the Task object that matches the name.</p><h4 id="printAllTasks"><a href="#printAllTasks" class="headerlink" title="printAllTasks"></a>printAllTasks</h4><p>Prints out all the tasks nicely including the tag lists for each task. It would be more convenient to have a method in the Task class that prints out one task. Then in the main class you only need to use a for loop to call each Task object’s print method.</p><h4 id="printTasksByDateRange"><a href="#printTasksByDateRange" class="headerlink" title="printTasksByDateRange"></a>printTasksByDateRange</h4><p>Ask for a begin date and end date and print the tasks between the two dates inclusively. It should not print any tasks if the begin date is later than the end date. You’ll need a method for comparing dates. This might be a good candidate for the Task class (or DueDate class) as you would only need to pass in as parameters one date and compare it with the fields in the Task class. Pass back a 1 for the passed in date being later, 0 for it being equal and 1 if the passed in date is earlier.</p><h4 id="printTodaysSchedule"><a href="#printTodaysSchedule" class="headerlink" title="printTodaysSchedule"></a>printTodaysSchedule</h4><p>A schedule for today consists of printing all past due tasks, then all of today’s task and then all future tasks in that order. In order to do the comparison, the program needs the current data. You can ask the user for this when the program starts up (do this before going into the while loop and keep the current date as a class level variable). Optionally, you can import the java.util.Calendar class to get the current month, day and year but it’s more complicated than just asking the user for the current date.</p><h4 id="deleteTask"><a href="#deleteTask" class="headerlink" title="deleteTask"></a>deleteTask</h4><p>Ask the user for a name. Find the task with the name. If the name is not there, print an error message and return to the main menu. Else, delete task from the list. For an array, you may have to move the tasks after the deleted task to fill in the ‘hole’ in the array. For ArrayList, you don’t need to do this; just use ‘remove’ method.</p><h4 id="modifyTask"><a href="#modifyTask" class="headerlink" title="modifyTask"></a>modifyTask</h4><p>Ask the user for a name. Find the task with the name. If the name is not there, print an error message and return to the main menu. Else, print another submenu of possible fields to change: name, description, due date and add or delete tags (see output). Then allow the user to pick a field and change just that attribute in that task. You get point deducted if you force the user to re-enter all information for a task rather than for one field.</p><h4 id="quit"><a href="#quit" class="headerlink" title="quit"></a>quit</h4><p>Quit should also be a choice in the menu. This should print a goodbye message and quit the program.</p><p>Although not necessary, I would suggest putting 3 or 4 tasks into the list when starting up the program. This way you don’t have to re-create a set of tasks every time you run the program. This makes debugging go much faster.</p><h3 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h3><p>You must create and use a Task class; the TaskDate class is optional. You must have the above methods in your program; these go in the TaskManager class. All method listed should be called and work properly.</p><p>There should only one array in the main TaskManager class. This should hold Task objects. The Task class also has an array of String objects for hold tags for each task. You will get points off if you have any other arrays in your code.</p><p>The fields in your Task class must be private. So you need methods for ‘setting’ and ‘getting’ the fields in your class. These methods should be public. Also, allow the user to add or delete tags in the tag list (no need for a modify for tags) using public methods for this (like addTag and deleteTag which takes a String tag and either adds to the list of tags or finds and deletes from the list of tags).</p>]]></content>

(Note: You do not have to have an Android phone, since this will be done on an emulator.) The human user plays against the computer, which uses an AI search to choose its moves, either minimax with alpha-beta pruning or A*.</p><p>The usual rules of tic-tac-toe apply: X (which is the computer) goes first, players take turns, and the game ends when one player wins by filling 5 squares in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all squares are filled (a tie, commonly referred to as “the cat got the game”).</p><p>When the game starts, the user selects the level of difficulty: easy, medium, or hard, and which AI to play against, minimax or A*. Then the computer places an X in the center (hard), in a corner (medium), or on an edge but not a corner (easy level). The square selected should be different each time the same level is selected; either cycle through the choices or pick a square at random. Each time the user clicks a square, place an O there and check for end of game. If the game is not over, run the chosen AI algorithm, display an X, and check for end of game.</p><ul><li>No more than one statement per line.</li><li>No function longer than 24 lines (one terminal window).</li><li>No line longer than 80 characters.</li><li>For the minimax search with alpha-beta pruning you may need some way of limiting the depth to avoid running out of memory or time. (The computer should move in 5 seconds or less.) The utility function X wants to maximize could be something like<figure class="highlight ada"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">f = (# <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">5</span> X<span class="symbol">'s</span> - # <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">5</span> O<span class="symbol">'s</span>) * <span class="number">16</span> ^ <span class="number">4</span> +</span><br><span class="line">    (# <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">4</span> X<span class="symbol">'s</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> a blank - # <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">4</span> O<span class="symbol">'s</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> a blank) * <span class="number">16</span> ^ <span class="number">3</span> +</span><br><span class="line">    (# <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">3</span> X<span class="symbol">'s</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">2</span> blanks - # <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">3</span> O<span class="symbol">'s</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">2</span> blanks) * <span class="number">16</span> ^ <span class="number">2</span> +</span><br><span class="line">    (# <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">2</span> X<span class="symbol">'s</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">3</span> blanks - # <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">2</span> O<span class="symbol">'s</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">3</span> blanks) * <span class="number">16</span> +</span><br><span class="line">    (# <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">1</span> X <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">4</span> blanks - # <span class="keyword">of</span> lines <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="number">1</span> O <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">4</span> blanks) </span><br><span class="line">since there are <span class="number">12</span> winning lines (rows, columns, <span class="keyword">and</span> diagonals) <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">16</span> &gt; <span class="number">12</span>.

If a win cannot be guaranteed no matter how O moves, then h(n) is the estimated number of additional moves to tie, without exceeding the actual number of moves required. If neither a win nor a tie can be guaranteed for X, then h(n) is the estimated number of additional moves till the game ends with O winning.</p><p>Here are some ideas to get you started on A*:</p><ol><li>For each move, start A<em> over by using the current board state as the initial A</em> state. Generate the successor states (legal X moves) as possible values of n and calculate f(n) = g(n) + h(n). This makes g(n) always 1, since it takes 1 move to get from the initial state to n.</li><li>If there are 4 X’s and a blank in 2 rows, columns, or diagonals, and there are no lines with 4 O’s and a blank, then you can win in 2 more moves guaranteed, namely, O moves and then X wins, so h is 2.</li><li>If there are 3 X’s and 2 blanks in a row, column, or diagonal, then it will take at least 4 more moves. However, you must also consider how close O is to winning and whether blocking O is more urgent. For example<figure class="highlight asciidoc"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="code"> X | X |   |   | X</span></span><br><span class="line">-------------------</span><br><span class="line"><span class="code">   | X |   |   | </span></span><br><span class="line">-------------------</span><br><span class="line"><span class="code">   |   |   |   | </span></span><br><span class="line">-------------------</span><br><span class="line"><span class="code">   |   |   |   | </span></span><br><span class="line">-------------------</span><br><span class="line"><span class="code"> O | O |   | O | O</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li></ol><p>will end in a tie (assuming both players make the best move), so h would be 17 (the number of blanks). Thus you need to consider not only the squares which need X’s to make 5 in a row, but also the squares which need X’s to block O’s moves; some squares may do both.</p><p>If a node (board state) n would allow O to win in 1 move, then assign a “too big” value to h(n), e.g., 25, to insure that A* will not move to state n unless X cannot win or tie.</p><p>There are numerous 3 by 3 tic-tac-toe Android apps on the Internet, which you can use for ideas if you cite them. However, if you are going to make your million with this game :-), you should not use any code or code ideas from others or you could be liable for copyright infringement and spend all your profits on lawyers and fines :-(. Note that some of these claim to use AI but really don’t!</p><p>This is a team project, with three or four students per team. (Teams of four will have an additional task.) Your assigned team should immediately meet and exchange all contact information and schedule at least one meeting per day. Choose a clever team name (but keep it clean :-)), discuss your strengths in Android, Java, C++, threads, GUI’s, XML, learning new IDE’s quickly, debugging, report writing, etc., and elect a team leader to coordinate the project.</p><p>Choose one person to have the primary responsibility for each of these tasks (although you will need to help the other two on their tasks as well):</p><ol><li>Choose a free Android emulator (Android Studio recommended, but you might want to look at MIT’s “invention machine”) and install it where all team members can use it. Write an XML GUI and the main part of the game in the Android subset of Java and find out how to call a C++ function from it.</li><li>Write a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning in C++ and interface it to the main Java program.</li><li>Write an A* search in C++ and interface it to the main Java program.</li><li>(Team of four only) A clever way to get more time for the AI search is to use the human’s “think time” (which doesn’t count against the 5-second limit for the computer to move) in a separate thread. In other words, as soon as the computer places an X, the second thread immediately starts searching ahead. Then when the human “finally” enters a move, the 5-second clock starts, the main thread tells the second thread to take O’s move and only continue searching that subtree. If the search has not completed in 4.5 seconds, tell the second thread to stop when the current ply is finished, then make the best move and start the second thread over searching ahead.</li></ol><p>Follow the Agile methodolgy as described in the slides, including:</p><ul><li>a master burn-down list of remaining tasks and estimated time for each task</li><li>at least 2 “weekly” meetings to assign tasks from the burn-down list</li><li>at least 10 “daily” scrums (15-minute meetings) to report progress and problems and update the burn-down list items and time still needed</li><li>a graph of projected and actual burn-down rate<br>If the game is complete then consider adding sound (like a meow for a tie), color, motion, blinking screen for “You beat the computer!!!”, etc.</li></ul><h3 id="Deliverables"><a href="#Deliverables" class="headerlink" title="Deliverables"></a>Deliverables</h3><p>Create a team project 3 repository on github and grant access to the instructor and the TA in addition to your team members.</p><p>Identify all the tasks in the project that you can and post that to your repository as the initial project task burn-down list, with the estimated number of days for each task. Add new items you discover are needed and delete items when they are finished.</p><p>Each team must maintain a development log (wiki page in github titled “Development Log”) updated by the team members. This log will be graded. There is no designated format, except that you need to time stamp, write down the name, and write a brief description of the activity, as in Project 2. We will check your daily progress.</p><p>Major routines should include unit testing. Demo in the lab may be required.</p><h3 id="Test-session-log"><a href="#Test-session-log" class="headerlink" title="Test session log"></a>Test session log</h3><p>This is a human-readable transcript of at least two complete games, one using minimax and one using A*, showing the board in graphical form, the number of nodes expanded, and the time required (user plus system) to calculate the AI move.

Note that 25% is the baseline (equal contribution by all four members).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>This assignment builds on the previous assignment’s theme of examining memory access patterns. You will implement a finite difference solver for the 2D heat diffusion equation in different ways to examine the performance characteristics of the different implementations.</p><h3 id="Background-on-the-heat-diffusion-PDE"><a href="#Background-on-the-heat-diffusion-PDE" class="headerlink" title="Background on the heat diffusion PDE"></a>Background on the heat diffusion PDE</h3><p>To solve this PDE, we are going to discretize both the temporal and the spatial derivatives. To do this, we define a two-dimensional grid G(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n(x), 1 ≤ j ≤ n(y), where we denote by n(x) (resp. n(y) ) the number of points on the x-axis (resp. y-axis). At each time-step, we will evaluate the temperature and its derivatives at these gridpoints.</p><p>While we will consistently use a first order discretization scheme for the temporal derivative, we will use 2nd, 4th or 8th order discretization of the spatial derivative.</p><p>If we denote by T(i, j) the temperature at time t at point (i, j) of the grid, the 2nd order spatial discretization scheme can be written.</p><p>The C(x) (xfcl in the code) and C(y) (yfcl in the code) constants are called Courant numbers. They depend on the temporal discretization step, as well as the spatial discretization step. To ensure the stability of the discretization scheme, they have to be less than a maximum value given by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. You do not have to worry about this, because the starter code already takes care of picking the temporal discretization step as to maximize the Courant numbers while ensuring stability.</p><p>The starter code also contains host and device functions named stencil which contain the coefficients that go into the update equation. Therefore, you do not need to figure out how to implement the different order updates. You only need to understand how this function works and pass in the arguments correctly.</p><h3 id="Boundary-conditions"><a href="#Boundary-conditions" class="headerlink" title="Boundary conditions"></a>Boundary conditions</h3><p>The starter code contains the functions that will update the boundary conditions for you (see file BC.h, in particular the function gpuUpdateBCsOnly) and the points that are in the border (which has a size of order / 2). This way, you do not have to worry about the size of the stencil as you approach the wall.</p><h3 id="Various-implementations"><a href="#Various-implementations" class="headerlink" title="Various implementations"></a>Various implementations</h3><p>In this programming assignment, we are going to implement 2 different kernels (and you can do a third one for extra credit):</p><ul><li><p>Global (function gpuStencil): this kernel will use global memory and each thread will update exactly one point of the mesh. You should use a 2D grid with n(x) × n(y) threads total.</p></li><li><p>Block (function gpuStencilLoop): this kernel will also use global memory. Each thread will update numYPerStep points of the mesh (these points form a vertical line). You should also use a 2D grid with n(x) × n(y) / numYPerStep threads total.</p></li><li><p>(Extra Credit) Shared (function gpuShared): this kernel will use shared memory. A group of threads must load a piece of the mesh in shared memory and then compute the new values of the temperatures on the mesh. Each thread will load and update several elements.<br>Parameter file</p></li></ul><p>The parameters used in the computation are read from the file params.in.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>For this project, you will implement a JavaFX-based two-player (human vs. computer) version of the dice game called Cosmic Wimpout. You will need to use many or all of the techniques covered in class this semester, like arrays, classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and GUI programming.</p><p>Cosmic Wimpout is played with five six-sided dice. Four of these dice have the following values printed on their faces: 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The fifth die is called the “Sun” die, and has the image of a star (the “Flaming Sun”) in place of the 3. Thus, its faces have the values 10, 2, *(sun), 4, 5, and 6. The sun is treated as a wild value; that is, it may be substituted for any other face value. During a player’s turn, he rolls all five of these dice.</p><p>Play follows the official rules:</p><ol><li>The players agree on a game goal, usually 300 or 500 points (this is known as the Winning Total). The first player to exceed this score wins the game.</li><li>Each player rolls one of the regular dice (not the “Sun” die). The player who rolls the highest face value goes first (10 beats 6). If a tie occurs, the tied players roll again.<br>When it becomes a player’s turn, he begins by rolling all five dice, and counts up the score for that roll:</li><li>Five matching faces are called a Freight Train. A Freight Train is worth a number of points equal to 100 times the face showing on any one die. For example, a Freight Train consisting of five 4’s is worth 400 points.</li><li>If a player rolls five sixes, he automatically wins the game.</li><li>Too Many Points: Rolling five 10’s (a Supernova) automatically knocks a player out of the game.<br>Three matching faces on the same throw are called a flash, and are worth 10 points times the face value. For example, three 5’s are worth 50 points.</li><li>If the “Flaming Sun” comes up, it can be used to form the third value in a flash, or it can be treated as a 5 or a 10 for the purposes of scoring. If a Flaming Sun is rolled along with a pair of any other values, the Flaming Sun MUST be used to form a flash.<br>5’s and 10’s that do not form part of a flash are worth 5 or 10 points, respectively.</li><li>If a player rolls something other than numbers (5 or 10), flashes, or a Freight Train, he is said to have wimped out, and loses his turn. He does not gain any points for that turn.</li><li>If a player rolls anything that will earn him points during a turn (a 5 or 10 on one or more dice, or a flash, or a freight train), he may set aside those dice and re-roll the remaining dice to accumulate more points. He may continue to re-roll and accumulate points until he either wimps out (losing all points for the turn) or chooses to stop voluntarily.</li><li>A player officially enters the game when he gets 35 or more points on his first roll. Until a player enters the game, he does not accumulate any points from rolling the dice. Your program should announce when each player enters the game.<br>You May Not Want To But You Must: If a player scores with all five dice, he must continue his turn and roll all five dice again. He continues to accumulate points until he either wimps out or scores with four or fewer dice.</li><li>The Futtless Rule: All flashes must be cleared. To clear a flash (three of a kind), a player must re-roll all non-scoring dice. If one or more of the re-rolled dice match the dice that make up the flash, the player must repeat the re-roll until none of them match the flash value.</li><li>The current player may voluntarily end his turn whenever he rolls and does not wimp out, except when he has fewer than 35 points or is subject to the “You May Not Want To But You Must” rule or the Futtless Rule. When a player ends his turn without wimping out, he adds his accumulated points to his total.<br>12。 Last Licks: When a player reaches the Winning Total, each of the other players receives one last roll, which they must use to attempt to catch up in terms of points.</li></ol><p>Your program should use JavaFX to present an appealing user interface for the game (focus on implementing a text-based version of the game first, then add the GUI at the end).</p><h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>A player rolls<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">5 </span><span class="number">10</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The 5 and 10 are scoring dice, so they are set aside (for a total of 15 points so far). The player chooses to re-roll the remaining three dice, obtaining:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">10 </span><span class="number">10</span> <span class="number">4</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>(Note that this does not create a flash, since three 10s were not rolled at the same time)<br>Now the player chooses to stop (he has not wimped out, since he rolled at least one scoring die), and take his 35 points for the turn.<br>Suppose the current player rolls<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">5 </span><span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">5</span> * <span class="number">4</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>This creates a flash worth 50 points (the Flaming Sun counts as the third 5 for the purposes of the flash). This flash must be cleared, so the player re-rolls the 3 and 4, getting:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">2 </span><span class="number">5</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Since the 5 duplicates the flash that was just rolled, both dice must be re-rolled:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">10 </span><span class="number">3</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>This clears the flash (since the player didn’t roll a 5 this time), but 3 is a non-scoring value (remember that only 5 and 10 count as scoring values outside of a flash or freight train). As a result, the player has wimped out, and will not earn any points for this turn.</p><h3 id="Grading-Rubric"><a href="#Grading-Rubric" class="headerlink" title="Grading Rubric"></a>Grading Rubric</h3><p>This program is worth a total of 40 points, broken down as follows:</p><ul><li>Game correctly plays one turn by the human player - 10 points</li><li>Game correctly plays one turn by the computer - 10 points</li><li>Game correctly plays to completion - 10 points</li><li>Graphical User Interface - 10 points</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>Enterprise applications usually need to integrate with a number of legacy or third party systems to fulfill business requirements. In this assignment, your task is to provide a suitable integration solution to integrate the VideoStore application with the 3 other applications shown in Figure 1. Integration with these 3 applications is required in order to support the following workflow for submitting orders:</p><p>When an order is placed, the video store application should:</p><ul><li>Request a transfer of funds from the customer’s account to VideoStore’s account using the services provided by the Bank Application.</li><li>If the transfer is successful, the video store requests delivery for the purchased items from DeliverCo. DeliveryCo notifies the video store when delivery is complete. Further:</li><li>The customer is notified via email (using the EmailService) when a delivery is submitted to DeliveryCo, AND when DeliveryCo claims that the delivery is complete.</li><li>The stock levels for an ordered media item should also be updated if an order is successfully submitted.</li></ul><p>If the transfer fails, the customer is notified via email (using the EmailService) that there is a problem with their credit, and that the purchase order cannot proceed.</p><p>The four applications are currently integrated through synchronous point to point calls, and most of the workflow described above can be seen in VideoStore.Business.Components/OrderProvider::SubmitOrder().The solution is setup with a customer account username: “Customer” and password: “Customer”. We suggest you use this account for your testing. The current integration solution is functional, but isn’t ideal in addressing quality attributes like availability and reliability. In lectures and tutorials you looked at technologies including asynchronous messaging, message oriented middleware and web services. You will need to modify the integration solution provided and improve its availability and fault-tolerance. You need to take the following into account:</p><ol><li>How are the availability and reliability quality attributes improved? You need to show message diagrams for various cases of subsystem failure (eg What happens if the VideoStore is up and the Bank component is down?).</li><li>Apart from availability and reliability, how are the other quality attributes mentioned in the first lecture affected by your design? System architects need to make trade-offs between different quality attributes (eg: tolerating more failures vs improved performance when there are no failures), and this is acceptable as long as the architect can correctly justify their choices.</li></ol><p>You will need to consider how your solution handles failure conditions (not just the one above but also any other failure conditions you can identify). You can assume that the delivery company will eventually be successful in delivering any orders they receive but that their system may go down. In your submission you will need to include a report which describes your integration solution and answers questions 1, and 2, giving specific scenarios that illustrate how your integration solution improves availability and fault tolerance, and how your solution affects other quality attributes.</p><h3 id="Group-Formation"><a href="#Group-Formation" class="headerlink" title="Group Formation"></a>Group Formation</h3><p>Each group should contain 3 students. In exceptional cases (with lecturer’s permission in advance) a group may have 4 students, but such a group may be required to take on additional work.</p><p>A group is formed when the students involved each join it through the sign-up sheet on the eLearning site for comp5348. Once someone joins a group, they can see the Assignment itself.</p><h3 id="Deliverables"><a href="#Deliverables" class="headerlink" title="Deliverables"></a>Deliverables</h3><p>A zipped file containing source code for your application and a readme file explaining how to run your application.</p><p>A description of how your code works focusing on message exchanges between your components and showing how you will handle the unavailability of various systems. You should justify trade-offs that you made. That is, your report must include answers to questions 1 and 2 from the assignment description.</p><p>A copy of the Academic Honesty cover sheet (group work version) signed by all members of the group Submit deliverables 1 and 2 through eLearning, and hand in deliverable 3 in person at the lab.</p><h3 id="Some-Q-amp-A"><a href="#Some-Q-amp-A" class="headerlink" title="Some Q &amp; A"></a>Some Q &amp; A</h3><blockquote><p>Q1) How do I run the 4 applications and the VideoStore web-client?</p></blockquote><p>A1) a) Create the Videos, Bank, and Deliveries databases along with their associated tables.<br>b) Start each of the applications by right clicking on the following projects, and then clicking on Debug &gt; Start New Instance : Bank.Process; DeliveryCo.Process; EmailService.Process; VideoStore.Process. You can then also start the VideoStore web client by right clicking on VideoStore.WebClient and then clicking on Debug &gt; Start New Instance. Remember to login with the username “Customer” and the password “Customer” (both without the quotes).</p><blockquote><p> Q2) Do I need to modify the EmailService so that it actually sends emails?</p></blockquote><p>A2) No, the EmailProvider simply needs to print out that a message was sent to a certain address for this assignment (which is the current implementation).</p><blockquote><p>Q3) The debugger stops when I try to place an order when the Customer has insufficient funds; or when I place an order for a media item with insufficient stock. How can I observe the application functionality without the debugger stopping in these situations?</p></blockquote><p>A3) Before placing your order you can “Detach” the debugger (Debugger &gt; Detach All) to observe the overall functionality in the question’s scenarios without being interrupted by the debugger.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>In this project, you are to design and implement an Instant Messaging App (IM App) using the Model View Controller architecture design with delegates. The IM App consists of a front-end (Client) and a back-end (Server) component.</p><p>The IM App builds on the WebSocket Chat Client/Server Apps exercises that we did in class on with some additional functionality as listed bellow:</p><ul><li>Users can log in/out from the Server; logging in requires a name and password, which are managed in the Server and must be persisted across running sessions by serializing the account objects as a JSON string stored in a file.</li><li>Once logged in, users can manage their contact list by adding and removing contact entries.</li><li>At the client side, the contact list shows each contact’s status (online/offline). This status is dynamically updated as the users in the list log in/out from the server.</li><li>A user X, while online, can establish a 2-way chat session with another user (with online status) in X’s contact list. Conversations are not recorded/saved in the Server.</li><li>While user X is chatting with user Y, any of them can add a third user Z (also online) to have a group chat.</li><li>Similar to the class exercise, the Client and Server Apps communicate via a WebSocket connection. Moreover, each chat message should be time-stamped and the client GUI should indicate who sends the message in the chat window.</li></ul><h3 id="Use-Cases"><a href="#Use-Cases" class="headerlink" title="Use Cases"></a>Use Cases</h3><p>As you might have experienced when using some IM app, there are many IM features that can be provided. Bellow are the minimal use cases that your solution must provide.</p><p>Log in/Sign in. A user A launches the Client app (C) and enters a name (n) and password (p) to log into the Server (S). Server S can respond to C in two ways:</p><p>Login is successful – if p matches what is in n’s account record, or if n is a new name, in this case, S creates a new account with name n and password p.</p><p>Login is unsuccessful – if p does not match the information in n’s account records.</p><p>Server-Client Synch. After a successful login, Server S communicates A’s contact list to client C (empty if n is a new name), and let other online users, that have A in their contact lost, know that A is now online, (the other user’s contact list displays A as online). A can use client C to do any of the following:</p><p>Add a new contact. A enters contact name (e.g. b). If an account exists in server S with name b, server S adds b to A’s contact list (persisted), and let client A know so it can update/display A’s contact list appropriately. Otherwise, (if b does not exists), server S notifies client C (and thus A) that b does not exists.</p><p>Remove an existing contact (e.g. C). A selects the contact c from A’s contact list, confirms/cancels the removal of the contact. If confirmed, server S removes c from A’s contact list (persisted, and let client A know). If cancelled, nothing should happen.</p><p>Chat with a contact (or more) (e.g. D) that is online. Client A opens a chat window where A can send messages to D (and vice versa). Server S sends both clients (e.g. A and D) the contact list that both have in common.</p><p>Either A or D add a third client E to the chat (E is common to A and D). Server S sends E the chat history for that particular session.</p><p>Log out. Server S notifies other online users that have A in their contact list that A is now offline (the other user’s client displays A status accordingly).</p><p>Note that the above description left out some details; for example, when A is chatting with D And somehow D goes offline, should A’s client close the chat window? In such unspecified cases, you are given the degree of freedom to creatively decide how your solution should behave.</p><h3 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h3><h4 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h4><p>In this phase, you are to write use case realizations, create class and state diagrams for your server and client apps. The goal of your architecture design is to increase/benefit coupling and cohesion, and non functional requirements like. Here is the list of artifact expected in your design:</p><p>Elaborate a detailed Use Case Realization for the Use Cases “Add a new contact” and “Log out”.</p><p>Class Diagrams for your solution that follows the MVC architecture with interfaces, delegates, and patterns as appropriate. Note that your class diagram should include classes (whose objects will be de/serialized) for client/server communication. You can submit your diagrams as PDF files generated form a computer program (e.g. Visio), or scanned if you create nice and CLEAR drawings.<br>State Diagrams for the controllers in your MVC.</p><h4 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h4><p>In this phase, you are to implement the client and the server apps that fulfill all the functional requirements described in the Use Cases. If you have made some revisions on your diagrams, submit the revised class and state diagrams along with your implementation.</p><h4 id="Submission"><a href="#Submission" class="headerlink" title="Submission"></a>Submission</h4><p>Design<br>Your submissions should consist of PDF documents named TeamN-FP-DesignName.PDF, where N is your team number, and DesignName can be “UCR” for use case realization, “CD” for class diagram, or “SD” for state diagram.</p><h4 id="Implementation-1"><a href="#Implementation-1" class="headerlink" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h4><p>VS projects, C# code, and other files should be submitted using your GitHub account. Each team member must upload to GitHub his or her team solution.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Probabilistic-graphical-models"><a href="#Probabilistic-graphical-models" class="headerlink" title="Probabilistic graphical models"></a>Probabilistic graphical models</h3><p>Your task is to write a program to implement likelihood weighted sampling, as described in lecture 18, to perform inference on an arbitrary probabilistic graphical model (PGM) of boolean random variables. You will need to parse an input text file that encodes the graph and the conditional probability distributions for each variable (conditioned on its parents). The format of the file is given in the section below. Two networks have been defined in this format and can be downloaded, along with two queries each from the forum, in file ass3.zip.</p><p>Your program must be able to parse any file of this format to create and populate an internal data structure of the PGM.<br>Your program must then prompt the user via the console (or read from redirected standard input) for a single variable query, parse the query correctly and evaluate the conditional probability distribution of the query variable, given the evidence. The result must be written as two decimal values (corresponding to the values of P(QueryVar=true|…) and P(QueryVar=false|…)) onto the standard output stream, separated by white space. For example:<br><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">0<span class="selector-class">.872</span> 0<span class="selector-class">.128</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Note that if you write anything else before these two numbers, automark will interpret that output as the answer, almost certainly resulting in a test failure.</p><h3 id="File-format"><a href="#File-format" class="headerlink" title="File format"></a>File format</h3><p>The graphical model will be specified by a text file with format:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">N</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">rv0 rv1 ... rvN<span class="number">-1</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">1</span> ... <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span> ... <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">1</span> ... <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">mat0</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">mat1</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">matN<span class="number">-1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Here:</p><ul><li>N is the number of random variables in the network;</li><li>rv are the random variable names (arbitrary alphanumeric strings);</li><li>mat are two dimensional arrays of real numbers (in ASCII) that specify the conditional probability table of each random variable conditioned on its parents;</li><li>The matrix of zeros and ones specifes the directed arcs in the graph; a one (1) in the i,j entry indicates there is an edge from i to j (so the ith variable is a parent of the jth variable.</li></ul><p>The format of the Conditional Probability Table (CPT) matrices is a bit subtle. If a node has m parents, then the matrix needs to specify the probability of each outcome (true, false) conditioned on 2^m different combinations of parent values, so the matrix will be 2^m × 2 (rows × columns). Treating true as 1, and false as 0, concatenate the values of the parents in their numerical order from most significant bit to least significant bit (left to right) to create a row index r. The entry in the first column, rth row is then the probability that the variable is true given the values of the other variables (the entry in the corresponding 2nd column is the probability that the variable is false). Thus, the first row of the matrix corresponds to all conditioning variables taken the value false (r = 000 … 0), and the last row has all conditioning variables true (r = 111 … 1).</p><h3 id="Deliverables"><a href="#Deliverables" class="headerlink" title="Deliverables"></a>Deliverables</h3><p>Write your program in Java or C/C++. In the case of Java, name your program inference.java.

This means you must create the assignment under your own SVN repository to store the submission files.</p><p>Your code will be compiled and run, testing its outputs for the two networks with two queries each that have been provided to you, and an additional three networks with two queries each. None of the networks will contain more than 16 variables. Since the results are stochastic, the query answers will not be exact and will vary from run to run. The asnwers will therefore be tested against a tolerance of ±0.01 (i.e. your answers must be within 1% of the true values), so you must ensure convergence to this level of precision. If it passes all tests you will get 15% of the overall course mark. The objective of the tests is to check for the correct operation of your implementation. Hence, the basis of the assessment is to compare your results against the expected results. You must also ensure that you have an efficient implementation.</p><h3 id="Using-other-source-code"><a href="#Using-other-source-code" class="headerlink" title="Using other source code"></a>Using other source code</h3><p>You may not use other source code for this assignment.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" class="headerlink" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h3><p>The goal of this assignment is to gain practical experience with implementing GUIs using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.</p><h3 id="Problem-description"><a href="#Problem-description" class="headerlink" title="Problem description"></a>Problem description</h3><p>In this assignment you will develop a GUI for simulating the behaviour of a train management system using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. This extends the work you have done in Assignments 1 and 2.</p><p>The train management system in question is quite simplistic. It manages the allocation of trains to sub-routes 1 for a particular track in a way that is guaranteed to prevent train collisions. The idea is that a train is only allowed to move along the sub-route it has been allocated to, but it can move freely along that sub-route without fear of colliding with another train.</p><p>There may be zero or more trains on the track. Each train on the track has a unique identifier (an integer), a route that it is following, and a sub-route of that route that it has currently been allocated to. The route a train is following must be on the track, and the sub-route that the train is allocated to must be a sub-route of the route that the train is following. The sub-routes that trains have been allocated to may not intersect.</p><p>Exactly what the GUI looks like is up to you, but in order to meet testing requirements, it must be capable of performing the following tasks:</p><ul><li>When the train management program is executed (by running the main method in RailwayManager.java), the program should</li><li>load the track defined in the file track.txt using the read method from TrackReader.</li><li>initialise itself so that it has no trains to begin with, and so that its track is set to be the track that was read in from the file.</li></ul><p>An appropriate error message should be clearly displayed (in the graphical user interface) if there is an error reading from the input file or there is an error with the input format (i.e. if TrackReader.read throws an IOException or a FormatException).</p><p>The error message displayed to the user should clearly identify the reason for the error. That is, it should identify that the file track.txt could not be loaded, and why. The reason should include whether or not the load error was due to an input/output error reading from the file, or because of an error with the input format of the file, and it should include the detail message of the exception thrown to help the user track down the exact reason for the problem.</p><p>If the track could not be loaded then the program, after informing the user of the problem, is not obliged to perform the remainder of the tasks specified here. It should either exit gracefully or allow the user to close the program without being able to perform any other functions. If the track could be loaded, then the track of the program should be set to be the track that was read, and it should be evident to the user that there are currently no trains on the track.</p><p>Note that a sample file called track.txt has been included in the assignment zip file, but that your code should not be hard-coded to only handle the current content of that input file - the content of the file should be able to be updated to represent any track.<br>Assuming that the track for the train management program can be loaded, the user should be able to use the program to perform the following tasks.</p><p>At any point, the user should be able to request that a new train is added to the track. In particular the user should be able to input:</p><ul><li>the name of a file (e.g. route.txt) from which the route of that train can be read</li><li>a start and end-offset (startOffset and endOffset) on that route that specifies the sub-route of the train’s route that the train initially wants to be allocated to.</li><li>In response to such a request the program should:</li><li>load the route defined in the file specified using the read method from RouteReader.</li><li>check that the route read from the file is on the train management system’s track (i.e. use the onTrack method of the Route class),</li><li>check that the offsets define a valid sub-route of the route, route, that was read, i.e. 0 &lt;= startOffset &lt; endOffset &lt;= route.getLength().</li><li>check that the sub-route route.getSubroute(startOffset, endOffset) does not intersect with any of the sub-routes currently allocated to other trains. (Note: you can check whether or not a route intersects with another one using the intersects method of the Route class.)</li></ul><p>If either (i) the route could not be loaded, or (ii) the route could be loaded, but it is not on the train management system’s track, or (iii) the route could be loaded and is on the track, but the offsets do not define a valid sub-route of the route that was read, or (iv) the route could be loaded, it is on the track, and the sub-route is valid w.r.t. the train’s route, but the sub-route route.getSubroute(startOffset, endOffset) intersects with at least one of the sub-routes currently allocated to another train, then an appropriate error message should be clearly displayed (in the graphical user interface) to the user, and the train should not be loaded, and the existing trains and their allocations should not be modified in any way. The error message displayed to the user should clearly identify the reason for the error.</p><p>Otherwise the train, with its route, is added to the system and allocated to the sub-route that it requested. It should be given a unique integer identifier that corresponds to the order in which the train was loaded (i.e. the first train loaded has identifier 0, the second train loaded has identifier 1, the third train loaded has identifier 2, etc.)</p><p>If either (i) the offsets do not define a valid sub-route of the route that was read, or (ii) the sub-route route.getSubroute(startOffset, endOffset) intersects with any of the sub-routes currently allocated to other trains, then an appropriate error message be clearly displayed (in the graphical user interface) to the user, and the existing trains and allocations should not be modified in any way. The error message displayed to the user should clearly identify the reason for the error. Otherwise, the allocation of the train should be updated to the requested allocation.</p><p>Your program should be robust in the sense that incorrect user inputs should not cause the system to fail. Appropriate error messages should be displayed to the user if they enter incorrect inputs.</p><h3 id="Task"><a href="#Task" class="headerlink" title="Task"></a>Task</h3><p>Using the MVC architecture, you must implement RailwayManager.java in the railway.gui package by completing the skeletons of the three classes: RailwayModel.java, RailwayView.java and RailwayController.java that are available in the zip files that accompanies this assignment. (Don’t change any classes other than RailwayModel.java, RailwayView.java and RailwayController.java since we will test your code with the original versions of those other files.)</p><p>You should design your interface so that it is legible and intuitive to use. The purpose of the task that the interface is designed to perform should be clear and appropriate. It must be able to be used to perform the tasks as described above.</p><p>As in Assignment 1 and 2, you must implement RailwayModel.java, RailwayView.java and RailwayController.java as if other programmers were, at the same time, implementing the classes that instantiate them and call their methods. Hence:</p><ul><li>Don’t change the class names, specifications, or alter the method names, parameter types, return types, exceptions thrown or the packages to which the files belong.</li><li>You are encouraged to use Java 8 SE classes, but no third party libraries should be used. (It is not necessary, and makes marking hard.)</li><li>Don’t write any code that is operating-system specific (e.g. by hard-coding in newline characters etc.), since we will batch test your code on a Unix machine.</li><li>Your source file should be written using ASCII characters only.</li><li>You may define your own private or public variables or methods in the classes RailwayModel.java, RailwayView.java and RailwayController.java (these should be documented, of course).</li></ul><p>Implement the classes as if other programmers are going to be using and maintaining them. Hence:</p><ul><li>Your code should follow accepted Java naming conventions, be consistently indented, readable, and use embedded whitespace consistently. Line length should not be over 80 characters. (Hint: if you are using Eclipse you might want to consider getting it to automatically format your code.)</li><li>Your code should use private methods and private instance variables and other means to hide implementation details and protect invariants where appropriate.</li><li>Methods, fields and local variables (except for-loop variables) should have appropriate comments.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>In this assignment, you will continue to implement the component classes of a program for simulating the behaviour of a train management system.</p><h3 id="Task-Overview"><a href="#Task-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Task Overview"></a>Task Overview</h3><p>In brief, you will write a method for reading in the sections of a track from a file, and you will write a method for allocating routes to trains (so that they don’t collide). If you are a CSSE7023 student you will also be required to write a JUnit4 test suite for testing the track-reading method.</p><p>More specifically, you must code method read from the TrackReader class and method allocate from the Allocator class that are available in the zip file that accompanies this handout, according to their specifications in those files.</p><p>If you are a CSSE7023 student, you will also need to complete a systematic and understandable JUnit4 test suite for the read method in the skeleton of the TrackReaderTest class from the railway.test package. You may write your unit tests assuming that the classes that TrackReader depends on (e.g. the Junction, Section, Track classes and any of the Java 8 SE API classes) are implemented and functioning correctly. That is, you don’t need to create test stubs for these classes.</p><p>As in Assignment 1, you must complete these methods and classes as if other programmers were, at the same time, implementing classes that use it. Hence:</p><ul><li>Don’t change the class names, specifications, or alter the method names, parameter types, return types, exceptions thrown or the packages to which the files belong.</li><li>You are encouraged to use Java 8 SE API classes, but no third party libraries should be used. (It is not necessary, and makes marking hard.)</li><li>Don’t write any code that is operating-system specific (e.g. by hard-coding in newline characters etc.), since we will batch test your code on a Unix machine.</li><li>Any new methods or fields that you add to TrackReader or Allocator must be private (i.e. don’t change the specification of these classes.)</li><li>Your source file should be written using ASCII characters only.</li></ul><p>Implement the classes as if other programmers are going to be using and maintaining them. Hence:</p><ul><li>Your code should follow accepted Java naming conventions, be consistently indented, readable, and use embedded whitespace consistently. Line length should not be over 80 characters. (Hint: if you are using Eclipse you might want to consider getting it to automatically format your code.)</li><li>Any additional methods that you write, and fields that you introduce should be private to hide implementation details and protect invariants.</li><li>Private methods that you write must be commented using preconditions and postconditions (require and ensures clauses). Informal description is OK.</li><li>Fields and local variables (except for-loop variables) should have appropriate comments. Comments should also be used to describe any particularly tricky sections of code. However, you should also strive to make your code understandable without reference to comments; e.g. by choosing sensible method and variable names, and by coding in a straightforward way.</li><li>Any exceptions that are created and thrown should have appropriate messages to help the user understand why the exception was thrown. This is particularly important for the read method in TrackReader, since if there is an error with the file format, then the user will want to know what is wrong with it when a FormatException is thrown. Each FormatException thrown should have a meaningful message that accurately describes the problem with the input file format, including the line of the file where the problem was detected. (You can create a new FormatException with a message using the constructor that takes a string parameter.)</li><li>The methods that you have to write must be decomposed into a clear and not overly complicated solution, using private methods to prevent any individual method from doing too much.</li></ul><p>I recommend that you attempt to write loop invariants for all non-trivial while-loops in your code, but this is not compulsory.</p><p>The Zip file for the assignment also includes some other code that you will need to compile your classes as well as some junit4 test classes to help you get started with testing your code.</p><p>Do not modify any of the files in package railway other than TrackReader and Allocator, since we will test your code using our original versions of these other files. Do not add any new files that your code for these classes depends upon, since you won’t submit them and we won’t be testing your code using them.</p><p>The JUnit4 test classes as provided in the package railway.test are not intended to be an exhaustive test for your code. Part of your task will be to expand on these tests to ensure that your code behaves as required by the javadoc comments. (Only if you are a CSSE7023 student will you be required to submit your test file TrackReaderTest.java.) We will test your code using our own extensive suite of JUnit test cases. (Once again, this is intended to mirror what happens in real life. You write your code according to the “spec”, and test it, and then hand it over to other people … who test and / or use it in ways that you may not have thought of.)<br>If you think there are things that are unclear about the problem, ask on the piazza forum, ask a tutor, or email the course coordinator to clarify the requirements. Real software projects have requirements that aren’t entirely clear!</p><p>If necessary, there may be some small changes to the files that are provided, up to 1 week before the deadline, in order to make the requirements clearer, or to tweak test cases. These updates will be clearly announced on the Announcements page of Blackboard, and during the lectures.</p><h3 id="More-about-the-allocate-method-from-the-Allocator-class"><a href="#More-about-the-allocate-method-from-the-Allocator-class" class="headerlink" title="More about the allocate method from the Allocator class"></a>More about the allocate method from the Allocator class</h3><p>In this section we explain some of the terminology used in the specification of the allocate method.</p><h3 id="Submission"><a href="#Submission" class="headerlink" title="Submission"></a>Submission</h3><p>Submit your files TrackReader.java, Allocator.java (and TrackReaderTest.java and any of your track files that are used for testing in TrackReaderTest.java if you are a CSSE7023 student)<br>You can submit your assignment multiple times before the assignment deadline but only the last submission will be saved by the system and marked.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>A Web proxy is a program that acts as a middleman between a Web browser and an end server. Instead of contacting the end server directly to get a Web page, the browser contacts the proxy, which forwards the request on to the end server. When the end server replies to the proxy, the proxy sends the reply on to the browser.</p><p>Proxies are used for many purposes. Sometimes proxies are used in firewalls, such that the proxy is the only way for a browser inside the firewall to contact an end server outside. The proxy may do translation on the page, for instance, to make it viewable on a Web-enabled cell phone. Proxies are also used as anonymizers.</p><p>By stripping a request of all identifying information, a proxy can make the browser anonymous to the end server. Proxies can even be used to cache Web objects, by storing a copy of, say, an image when a request for it is first made, and then serving that image in response to future requests rather than going to the end server.</p><p>In this lab, you will write a Web proxy that logs requests. You will write a simple sequential proxy that repeatedly waits for a request, forwards the request to the end server, and returns the result back to the browser, keeping a log of such requests in a disk file. This will help you understand basics about network programming and the HTTP protocol.</p><h3 id="Logistics"><a href="#Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Logistics"></a>Logistics</h3><p>As always, you must work in a group of two or more people. You will need to upload the source code and have a TA checkoff your code.</p><h3 id="Hand-Out-Instructions"><a href="#Hand-Out-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Hand Out Instructions"></a>Hand Out Instructions</h3><p>If you want to, you may use the code provided by the book in the csapp.c, and csapp.h files. These can be downloaded from the course webpage.</p><h3 id="Implementing-a-Sequential-Web-Proxy"><a href="#Implementing-a-Sequential-Web-Proxy" class="headerlink" title="Implementing a Sequential Web Proxy"></a>Implementing a Sequential Web Proxy</h3><p>In this part you will implement a sequential logging proxy. Your proxy should open a socket and listen for a connection request. When it receives a connection request, it should accept the connection, read the HTTP request, and parse it to determine the name of the end server. It should then open a connection to the end server, send it the request, receive the reply, and forward the reply to the browser if the request is not blocked.<br>Since your proxy is a middleman between client and end server, it will have elements of both. It will act as a server to the web browser, and as a client to the end server. Thus you will get experience with both client and server programming.</p><h3 id="Logging"><a href="#Logging" class="headerlink" title="Logging"></a>Logging</h3><p>Your proxy should keep track of all requests in a log file named proxy.log. Each log file entry should be a file of the form:<br><figure class="highlight mathematica"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Date</span>: browserIP <span class="keyword">URL</span> size</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>where browserIP is the IP address of the browser, URL is the URL asked for, size is the size in bytes of the object that was returned. For instance:<br><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="selector-tag">Sun</span> 8 <span class="selector-tag">May</span> 2016 02<span class="selector-pseudo">:51</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:02</span> <span class="selector-tag">EST</span>: 128<span class="selector-class">.2</span><span class="selector-class">.111</span><span class="selector-class">.38</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Note that size is essentially the number of bytes received from the end server, from the time the connection is opened to the time it is closed. Only requests that are met by a response from an end server should be logged. We have provided the function format log entry in csapp.c to create a log entry in the required format.</p><h3 id="Port-Numbers"><a href="#Port-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="Port Numbers"></a>Port Numbers</h3><p>You proxy should listen for its connection requests on the port number passed in on the command line:<br><figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">unix&gt; .<span class="built_in">/proxy </span>15213</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>You may use any port number p, where 1024 ≤ p ≤ 65536, and where p is not currently being used by any other system or user services (including other students’ proxies). See /etc/services for a list of the port numbers reserved by other system services.</p><p>Your sequential proxy should correctly accept connections, forward the requests to the end server, and pass the response back to the browser, making a log entry for each request. Your program should be able to proxy browser requests to the following Web sites and correctly log the requests.</p><h3 id="Hints"><a href="#Hints" class="headerlink" title="Hints"></a>Hints</h3><p>Initially, you should debug your proxy using telnet as the client.</p><p>Later, test your proxy with a real browser. Explore the browser settings until you find “proxies”, then enter the host and port where you’re running yours. With Netscape, choose Edit, then Preferences, then Advanced, then Proxies, then Manual Proxy</p><p>Configuration. In Internet Explorer, choose Tools, then Options, then Connections, then LAN Settings. Check ‘Use proxy server’ and click Advanced. Just set your HTTP proxy, because that’s all your code is going to be able to handle.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>Telling the difference between two different authors has many applications. This assignment will compare the relative frequency of words in works by William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon. Before the two works can be analyzed, they will need to be stored in memory. To do this, we will use two different hashing techniques, one that utilizes chaining and the other quadratic probing.</p><h3 id="Assignment"><a href="#Assignment" class="headerlink" title="Assignment"></a>Assignment</h3><p>You are to implement two separate hash tables, one per author, and use them to store the number of times a word appears in a text file. You will also write code that iterates through the hash tables and computes the relative frequency of words stored in each of the hash tables.</p><h3 id="Getting-started"><a href="#Getting-started" class="headerlink" title="Getting started"></a>Getting started</h3><p>The neccessary files are available in the archive, included in this archive are:</p><ul><li>Two text files: hamlet.txt and bacon-essays.txt. Code will be provided to read these works into arrays and add them to your hash tables. Note: they are very long. Do not print them.</li><li>FileInput.java: This class provides two functions which read text files into String arrays. readShakespeare() and readBacon() will return their corresponding text files as an array of strings, where each element of the array represents a word (in order) from the original text.</li><li>Test.java: This is where you will be expected to insert the data into your hash tables and then compare similarities between the two provided documents.There are four goals to accomplish in this file.</li></ul><ol><li>Initialize the two hash tables and insert the elements from the readShakespeare() String array into one hash table and the readBacon() String array into the other. Keep an associated count for the number of times a word is added in the hash table.</li><li>Iterate through the elements of one hash table and calculate how frequently that word occurs in both texts by using findCount() of a certain word divided by the lengths of the arrays from the readShakespeare() and readBacon() functions in FileInput. Use a squared-error approach.If a word appears in one text and not in the other, then add the square of the frequency of that word to the error. If the word appears in both texts, then find the difference between the two frequencies and add the square to the total error. For example, if Shakespeare uses a word 0.001 of the time and Bacon uses the same word 0.0001 of the time, subtract these two frequencies from each other (which would be 0.00099), square that result and add it to a “total comparative error” variable which keeps track of the sum of all such events.</li><li>Repeat this process for the second hash table, making sure not to duplicate any of the squared-errors you have already added to the “total comparative error” variable from above. This means you only have to consider words that are not in the first hash table when calculating for the second. As a note: the sum from both hash tables should go into the same variable.</li><li>Print the results. In addition to printing the final “Total comparative error”, print the word with the highest difference in frequency. For example, if Shakespeare uses the word “dog” much more frequently than Bacon, your final printed result should look like:<figure class="highlight mathematica"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Total</span> <span class="keyword">Square</span> Error: <span class="number">1.126343843E-4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Most</span> different word: dog</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li></ol><p>The number provided here is just an example, but you should expect numbers to be much smaller than one.</p><ul><li>The final files will be your two hash tables: QPHash.java and ChainingHash.java. Both will be required to support the same functionality, their only difference will be how they deal with collisions in the hash. Keep in mind that the differences in hash strategies will cause differences in all of the functions listed below. These are the functions we expect your hash tables to support:</li><li>Two constructors: the first instantiates the hash table to a default size and the other instantiates the hash table to an input size.</li><li>insert(String keyToAdd): This function will add the input string into your hash table. If the string is already in the hash table, it should increase the count of that corresponding string. If not, instantialize the count to one.</li><li>findCount(String keyToFind): This function will return the count for a particular String key. To be clear, this count variable will be the same as returning the number of times a particular key has been added to the hash table.</li><li>getNextKey(): Every call of getNextKey() will return the next key in the hash table. This function should utilize an interior cursor to iterate through the hash table. This function will be essential when computing the squared error.<br>Computing the hash codes for a string can be done by using the [insert String variable name].hashCode() system call that is part of the Java library. However, for extra credit, write a separate hash code that returns a unique integer for any input String. Also make sure that the resulting hash distributes Strings evenly over a large range of numbers or your hash table performance will suffer.</li></ul><h3 id="Grading"><a href="#Grading" class="headerlink" title="Grading"></a>Grading</h3><p>Submission for this assignment requires three files to be submitted: QPHash.java, ChainingHash.java and Test.java should be submitted to the dropbox to complete the homework.</p><ul><li>insert, findCount and getNextKey will be worth 5 points each for both hash tables, for a total of 30 points.</li><li>Correctly calculating the squared-error and most different word frequency will be worth 5 points each for a total of 10 points.</li><li>As usual, 5 points will be awarded for clean, well-commented code.</li><li>The extra credit of creating your own hash function will be worth up to 5 points subject to how well it performs in evenly distributing input Strings.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>This assignment is about the programming of database interaction code within an application, building on the car-sharing database scenario introduced in Assignments 1 and 2. The objectives are to gain practical experience interacting with a relational database using an Application Programming Interface (API) and transaction programming, and to understand the importance and application of basic security measures. There are also opportunities to use more advanced database</p><p>pplication programming techniques, such as stored procedures, triggers, indexes and access control privileges. We also included an optional extension regarding a suitable interface design.</p><p>This is a group assignment for teams of about 3 members, and it is assumed that you will continue in your Assignment 2 group. You should inform your tutor as soon as possible if you wish to change groups.</p><p>Please also keep an eye on the discussion forum and further announcements in Piazza.</p><h4 id="Design-Brief-Programming-a-Car-Sharing-Client-Application"><a href="#Design-Brief-Programming-a-Car-Sharing-Client-Application" class="headerlink" title="Design Brief: Programming a Car-Sharing Client Application"></a>Design Brief: Programming a Car-Sharing Client Application</h4><p>In this assignment your task is to implement the functions required to support the database interactions of an online car-sharing system, hosted on the School’s PostgreSQL server. You will be provided with a reference schema for PostgreSQL, as well as some example data. We will also provide a complete user interface written in Python, for which you need to write the appropriate database interaction functions using the Python DB-API introduced in Week 8. In writing these functions you should consider the following issues, which will be taken into account during marking:</p><h4 id="SQL"><a href="#SQL" class="headerlink" title="SQL"></a>SQL</h4><p>Your code should make best use of the database to correctly retrieve and update data. In particular, you should avoid writing client-side code for operations, such as joins, that could be better done within the database.</p><h4 id="Transaction-Handling"><a href="#Transaction-Handling" class="headerlink" title="Transaction Handling"></a>Transaction Handling</h4><p>You should assume that multiple clients will be running concurrently on the same database, so your functions should make suitable use of transactions. You should consider where to commit or roll back these transactions, and what to do if a transaction fails. D/HD students should also select appropriate isolation levels for their transactions.</p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p>Multi-tier architectures increase the scope for nefarious users to gain unintended access to query or modify your database. You should take steps to limit this by preventing SQL Injection attacks, and limiting the privileges available to the client to specific operations on tables, views and stored procedures.</p><h4 id="Stored-Procedures"><a href="#Stored-Procedures" class="headerlink" title="Stored Procedures"></a>Stored Procedures</h4><p>Network traffic can be reduced (and cross-client portability increased) by wrapping complex database operations into stored procedures that are run within the database rather than in the client. You should make use of these where appropriate.</p><h3 id="Core-Functionality"><a href="#Core-Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Core Functionality"></a>Core Functionality</h3><h4 id="Login"><a href="#Login" class="headerlink" title="Login"></a>Login</h4><p>At the login screen, members can log in with their email address (or optionally their nickname) and password. Your interface should verify those values against the data stored in your database. When a valid user/password combination is entered, members shall be directed to the member home screen.</p><h4 id="Home-Screen"><a href="#Home-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Home Screen"></a>Home Screen</h4><p>On the home screen, the user should be greeted with their full name, and see the following details:</p><p>The member’s membership plan and since when he is a member.<br>If selected, the name of his home bay.<br>Number of bookings made by user (from the statistical information stored for each member).</p><h4 id="New-Booking"><a href="#New-Booking" class="headerlink" title="New Booking"></a>New Booking</h4><p>A user should be able to use this page to make a booking of a car for a specific period. In making<br>the booking the application must:</p><p>Check availability (basic availability plus no clashes with other bookings).<br>Create a new booking entry.<br>Keep the member’s ‘number of booking’ statistics up-to-date.<br>Estimate the cost of the booking according to the member’s plan.<br>If successful, details are shown in the Booking Details screen.</p><h3 id="Submission-Details"><a href="#Submission-Details" class="headerlink" title="Submission Details"></a>Submission Details</h3><p>Please submit your solution in the ‘Assignment’ section of the unit e-learning site by the deadline, including the following items:<br>Client Source Code: For most groups this will be a modified version of the database.py, but if more substantial changes have been made you should provide a zip file containing each of the files you have changed, along with a short Changelog.txt file clearly summarising your group’s contributions to each file;</p><p>Database Schema DDL: If you have done any extensions that modify the database you should include all such additions (ALTER TABLE statements, views, server-side stored procedures, functions, triggers, indexes or grant statements for PostgreSQL which your created as plain text file with .sql file suffix). You should ensure that this file runs on a clean version of the original schema on the PostgreSQL 9.5 database without errors.</p>]]></content>
