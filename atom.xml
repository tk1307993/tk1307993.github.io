    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>You will create a text-based university student course scheduler. Each course object will contain information for the course department (a String) (e.g., “CS”; “MATH”; etc), course number (integer) (125; 315), course description (String) (e.g., “Introduction to Computer Science”; “Linear Transformations and Matrices”), starting hour (integer: use 24-hour clock: 0-23), a boolean variable requiredForMajor, an integer indicating the number of credit hours for the course, and days the course meets (an array of chars - ‘M’,’T’,’W’,’R’,’F’).</p><p>While the course scheduler program is running, the text-interface should look like this:<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Welcome <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> Course Scheduler!

Partial credit will be given for non-working code. Important: For maximum credit, in addition to a fully-functioning app, reviewers will be looking for good coding style such as: proper indentation, liberal use of constructors, data encapsulation, a short ‘main’ method and extensive use of subprograms. Use recursive methods whenever possible! Your code must also be checked into your subversion archive.</p><p>The following app behaviors will be expected for each option:</p><ol><li>add - The user will be prompted for information for a course to add (dept, number, description, whether it is in the students major, number of credit hours, and the time and days the course meets). The store will add the course in the appropriate location in the linked list, alphabetically sorted (by department and number) course list. For full credit, only add the course to the list provided the course day/time does not conflict with an already existing course. Partial credit will be awarded if you choose to not include this check. If conflict exists, the user will be prompted to enter a different course (call the add method again).</li><li>remove - The user will be shown a list of current courses in the schedule (use method 3 below) and will be prompted to choose a course to remove. The course selected will be removed from the inventory and the linked list correctly updated.</li><li>display courses alphabetically - the student’s courses will be displayed in alphabetical order by course (e.g., CS125 then Math 315 then PSYCH100) - all information for the course will be displayed: courseID, description, days it meets, number of credit hours, time/days it meets and a ‘*’ indicating the course is required for the student’s major.</li><li>display courses in major - only the student’s courses that are required for the major will be displayed in alphabetical order by course (e.g., CS125 then Math 315) - all information for the course will be displayed courseID, description, days it meets, credit hours, date/time it meets.</li><li>display schedule for day - the user will be prompted for a day of the week (MTWRF) and the schedule for the day will be displayed with courses ordered by starting hour.</li><li>display total number of credit hours - the total number of credit hours will be displayed for the current course list.</li><li>quit - the user will receive a prompt (“Are you sure you want to quit? - all your data will be lost.”) If the user replies yes, the app quits.</li></ol>]]></content>

Remember to commit your work early and often.</p><h3 id="Important-Notice"><a href="#Important-Notice" class="headerlink" title="Important Notice"></a>Important Notice</h3><p>This assignment will only be marked by the testing script on websubmission (because our tutors’ contracts end before the deadline). There will be six test cases (1 mark each). The total mark is six as usual. You don’t have to write a design, because the testing script won’t be able to understand it anyway. (But feel free to write one for your own benefit.) The testing script doesn’t care about your code style either, so feel free to use variable names like aa, bb, cc, dd (I know some of you love these kinds of names – well, jk, please don’t).</p><h3 id="Problem-Description"><a href="#Problem-Description" class="headerlink" title="Problem Description"></a>Problem Description</h3><p>Polish notation, also known as Polish prefix notation or simply prefix notation, is a form of notation for logic, arithmetic, and algebra. Its distinguishing feature is that it places operators to the left of their operands. (Many Lisp family programming languages require prefix notation, including the popular language Clojure.)</p><p>The expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is, in prefix notation, written “+ 1 2” rather than “1 + 2”. In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be nontrivial expressions including operators of their own. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">(<span class="number">5</span> + <span class="number">6</span>) * <span class="number">7</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>can be written in prefix as<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">* (+ <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">6</span>) <span class="number">7</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>You only need to care about binary operators: + - * and /</p><p>Also, you only need to care about operands that are from 0 to 9 (single digit).</p><p>For binary operators, prefix representation is unambiguous, and bracketing the prefix expression is un-necessary. As such, the previous expression can be further simplified to<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">* + <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">6</span> <span class="number">7</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 plus 6, then multiplies the result with 7). As with any notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in prefix notation this “innermost-ness” is conveyed by order rather than bracketing.</p><p>You are asked to create a class that converts prefix expressions to infix expressions. You are asked to use a tree data structure to achieve this task. (Hint: use a binary tree, use the leaf nodes to store the operands and use the non-leaf nodes to store the operators.)</p><p>Create a main function that takes in one line. The line contains a list of operators and operands separated by spaces. The input doesn’t contain parenthesis. An operator is a character from +, -, *, and /. An operand is an integer from 0 to 9. You are asked to determine whether this line describes a valid prefix expression.</p><p>If so, output its infix form. Otherwise, output “Error”. (Division by zero is considered error.)</p><p>When you output the infix form, the output format should follow two rules</p><figure class="highlight stata"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> <span class="keyword">input</span>: * - 5 6 7</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> output: (5 - 6) * 7</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> <span class="keyword">input</span>: * 5</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> output: <span class="keyword">Error</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> <span class="keyword">input</span>: * 5 6 7</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> output: <span class="keyword">Error</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> <span class="keyword">input</span>: + * - 5 6 7 3</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> output: ((5 - 6) * 7) + 3</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> <span class="keyword">input</span>: / + * - 5 6 7 3 9</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> output: (((5 - 6) * 7) + 3) / 9</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> <span class="keyword">input</span>: / + * - 5 6 7 3 0</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Sample</span> output: <span class="keyword">Error</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Task-Details"><a href="#Task-Details" class="headerlink" title="Task Details"></a>Task Details</h3><p>The Weeks 2 and 3 laboratory exercises contain a designated “Main Portfolio Exercise”. These are a series of exercises that add to each other to form a main portfolio program: TextQuest. You are to submit a final, completed version of that game.</p><p>uccessful completion of the exercises as described in the laboratory exercises may obtain you up to a maximum of 80% of the total assignment marks. In order to obtain a higher mark you should seek to include some advanced functionality (as described in the Week 3 portfolio description). The additional functionality should demonstrate advanced or more complex application of principles covered to date. It need not be large amounts of work but should demonstrate a willingness to explore new and advanced concepts. You must detail what you have done in an accompanying “readme” file.</p><p>The assignment must be created and submitted as a Visual Studio 2013 project. You may complete the exercises in your preferred IDE, however you should create a Visual Studio project in order to submit. This project must then be zipped up into one zip file for submission. The zip file MUST be named “FIT2071-AA1-YourAuthcateID.zip”. This zip file must be submitted via the Moodle assignment submission page. Note to reduce the file size of your zip, you can delete the “ipch” folder from your project before zipping without affecting your program.</p><p>Explicit assessment criteria are provided over the page, however please note you will be assessed on the following broad criteria:</p><ul><li>Meeting functional requirements as described in the exercise description</li><li>Demonstrating a solid understanding of the week’s C++ concepts, including good practice</li><li>Following the unit Programming Style Guide</li><li>Creating solutions that are as efficient and extensible as possible</li></ul><p>NOTE! Your submitted program MUST compile and run. Any submission that do not compile will be awarded zero marks. This means you should continually compile and test your code as you do it, ensuring it compiles at every step of the way.</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns please contact Tim as soon as possible.</p><h3 id="Week2"><a href="#Week2" class="headerlink" title="Week2"></a>Week2</h3><p>Main Portfolio Exercise: TextQuest</p><p>This week’s portfolio exercise is to begin building a (very simple) text-based Role Playing game. We will be building upon this exercise in the next week to culminate in the submission of a game built up with the 2 portfolio exercises from weeks 2 and 3. This week we will start by writing the basic structure of the code to create a character and save the character data to a file.</p><p>Step 1. Prompt the player to enter a name for their character and save that name to a file.</p><p>Step 2. You will also need to read a file containing the default statistics associated with the different character vocations that the player can choose. Add code to your program to read in the vocation file which is a comma-separated list, with four fields corresponding to: vocation, health, strength and magic. The vocation field is a text string, the remaining fields are smallish integers. Here’s an example vocation file:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Warrior,<span class="number">100</span>,<span class="number">120</span>,<span class="number">0</span> </span><br><span class="line">Mage,<span class="number">80</span>,<span class="number">60</span>,<span class="number">100</span> </span><br><span class="line">Rogue,<span class="number">60</span>,<span class="number">80</span>,<span class="number">50</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Your program should read this file, print the list of vocations to the console and ask the player to select one by entering its number in the list (starting from 0).</p><p>Now write out the character information to a file which should again be a comma separated file containing five fields: name, vocation, health, strength and magic. The health score should (initially) come from the value specified in the vocation file (the second field). Here’s an example output:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">TimTheMagical,Mage,<span class="number">80</span>,<span class="number">60</span>,<span class="number">100</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Bonus: What happens if we try to save another character? Why does this happen? How might we overcome this issue to allow us to save multiple characters?</p><p>Next week we will complete the basic game with code to resurrect the character from such a save file, make a turn loop where stuff happens pseudo-randomly affecting health until the character dies! Don’t worry, we will also start to do stuff with the strength and magic fields.</p><h3 id="Week3"><a href="#Week3" class="headerlink" title="Week3"></a>Week3</h3><p>Main Portfolio Exercise: TextQuest continued</p><p>This week’s portfolio exercise is to complete last week’s TextQuest game.</p><p>By now you should have a program that allows the user to create a character, choose the character’s name and choose a vocation for the character from a list of possible vocations and their health, strength and magic stats. Finally it should be saving the created character in a separate file (check last week’s lab portfolio exercise for details).</p><p>This week, we are going to again extend the program in several steps, we’re up to Step 3:</p><p>Step 3. Add to your code the ability to either read an existing character from the file created on a previous run, or create a new character from scratch.</p><p>Step 4. Now we are going to create the actual game loop. The game loop will apply a sequence of events that output a message to the screen and modify the character’s health score. Here’s a sample events file (also available on Moodle).<br><figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">An enemy Warrior hits you with his weapon!,-50 </span><br><span class="line">An enemy Mage casts an evil spell on you!,-20 </span><br><span class="line">You found a<span class="built_in"> health </span>potion!,25 </span><br><span class="line">An enemy Rogue backstabs you <span class="keyword">from</span> the shadows!,-40 </span><br><span class="line">You got eaten by a Dragon!,-1000</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>After each event, if the player’s health score is not yet 0, they should be prompted whether to continue (y/n). Answering ‘y’ will apply another event. Answering ‘n’ should end the loop. Before the program finishes it should write out the player’s current stats (in the same file as in Step 1/2).</p><p>HD Bonus: Implementing the basic functionality described in Steps 1-4 will enable you to achieve a maximum of 80% of the available marks. In order to achieve the final 20% (or “HD” component) you should seek to include some advanced functionality. The additional functionality should demonstrate advanced or more complex application of principles covered to date. It need not be large amounts of work but should demonstrate a willingness to explore new and advanced concepts. Note however that your program must still satisfy all functionality as detailed in Steps 1-4. You must describe your additions in the readme file included with your submission (see below).</p><p>Here are some ideas for things you could add:</p><ul><li>basic validation (check if the file is empty before trying to read from it, check that the name was not left blank, check that the vocation entered was within range etc.)</li><li>the ability to save/load multiple characters</li><li>events that allow the player to fight back at the cost of strength (if warrior/rogue) or magic (if mage)</li><li>a simple xp/level system</li></ul><p>Readme.txt Document: as described in the (separate) assignment hand-out you will also need to submit a brief text document explaining how your program works. To get marks for any extra functionality you may have implemented, it must be highlighted and explained clearly in this document.</p><p>Full details of submission are detailed in the assignment brief on Moodle. However, important things to note include:</p><ul><li>Your submitted program MUST compile and run in VISUAL STUDIO 2013. If a program will not compile it will be awarded ZERO marks. NO exceptions. This means you must continually compile and test your code!</li><li>You can discuss ideas with others, but your code and your readme.txt document must be your own work. We will be checking! Monash applies heavy penalties to students who plagiarise.</li></ul><p>Please note! It is not expected that you need to implement this game as an object-oriented solution. We will be writing fully object-oriented programs in the remaining assessment items.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="1-Aim"><a href="#1-Aim" class="headerlink" title="1. Aim"></a>1. Aim</h3><p>The purpose of this assignment is to:</p><ol><li>Create client files that use the class to model “real world” scenarios.</li><li>Instantiate objects, create arrays of objects.</li><li>Generate random integers and random Boolean values.</li><li>Call methods on objects.</li></ol><p>It is recommended that you read and understand all the instructions below before starting the exercises.</p><h3 id="2-Files-Needed"><a href="#2-Files-Needed" class="headerlink" title="2. Files Needed"></a>2. Files Needed</h3><p>You will be provided with starter files for both exercises in this assignment. Create a project in Eclipse for this assignment and copy both starter files into this project. Be sure to complete the standard header comments at the top of each file.</p><h3 id="3-To-be-Handed-In"><a href="#3-To-be-Handed-In" class="headerlink" title="3. To be Handed In"></a>3. To be Handed In</h3><p>The files HerdManager.java and FillTheCorral.java should be submitted on-line via the HW15 page on Blackboard. Be sure to name the file/class exactly as specified. There is no MPL component for this assignment.</p><h3 id="4-Programming-Exercises"><a href="#4-Programming-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="4. Programming Exercises"></a>4. Programming Exercises</h3><p>For both exercises below, a fully functioning Gate class is necessary. If you implemented your Gate class correctly, you can use that class. Note that the toString() method prints out a statement that is different from the toString() output. The toString() method should return the statement after the semicolon (and space) (i.e., after “West Gate: “ and “East Gate: “). You will need to update that method.</p><p>Note: when dealing with Gate objects in these exercises, you must use the interface (the methods) that was specified for the Gate class in HW14. You cannot add any new public behavior or modify the interface to your Gate class that was not specified in HW14.</p><h3 id="Exercise-1-HerdManager-java"><a href="#Exercise-1-HerdManager-java" class="headerlink" title="Exercise 1: HerdManager.java"></a>Exercise 1: HerdManager.java</h3><p>In this exercise, you will build a client program that simulates the movement of an escargatoire of snails in and out of a pen.</p><ol><li>Create a public static final integer HERD to indicate the size of your escargatoire. Set the constant to 24 for this simulation.</li><li>Create two gates in your main() method and call them westGate and eastGate. You will need to call both methods described below in the main() method.</li><li>Create the setGates() method that accepts as input parameters two Gate objects. This method will set the westGate to allow snails to re-enter the pen, leaving the pasture, and set the eastGate to OUT, to allow snails to leave the pen and go to pasture. Note: make sure the order of the parameters that are passed to this method is the following: westGate, eastGate.</li><li>Create the simulateHerd() method that accepts two Gate objects and a Random object as input parameters.</li></ol><p>Note: make sure the order of the parameters that are passed to this method are as listed above, where the order of the two Gate objects are: westGate, eastGate.</p><p>Set the number of snails in the pen equal to the size of the HERD. The method should run ten iterations of the simulation. In each iteration, randomly select one of the gates to the pen and move a random number of snails through that gate (in or out depending on the swing direction), thus changing the number of snails in the pen and out to pasture (an illustration is shown in Figure 1). Suggestion: to select a random gate, use nextBoolean() to get a random boolean value (only two possible values).</p><p>You must be sure that neither of these numbers (in the pen or out to pasture) is ever negative and that the sum total of snails is always equal to the size of the HERD. If, during some iteration, there are no snails currently out to pasture, then you should not randomly select a gate, but rather would move a random number of snails through the eastGate and out to pasture (an illustration is shown in Figure 2). You must do a similar thing when there are no more snails in the pen.</p><p>Also, the range of random numbers generated should change according to which gate you have selected and how many snails are currently available to go through that selected gate. However, the value should always be greater than zero.</p><p>Print out the status of the gates after creating the objects, after setting (opening) the gates, and the necessary information for each iteration as shown in the example execution of HerdManager.java below. Note that the first output line in the simulateHerd() method has been included in your starter file. Your output format must match the example execution exactly.</p><h4 id="Example-execution-1"><a href="#Example-execution-1" class="headerlink" title="Example execution 1"></a>Example execution

It’s a bit of a game really. Following the best practices for writing programs, fill in the methods provided in the starter file to accomplish the following. Use a Random object to initially set each of the four gates to a specific swing direction or closed. So, the gates for each of the four corrals will be set to swing IN to the corral, OUT of the corral, or remain locked (an illustration is shown in Figure 3). Note that one of these gates must be set to IN (more details in a moment).</p><p>The program begins with five snails out to pasture and an infinite number of snails in each corral. A random number of snails, not to exceed the number already out to pasture, attempt to pass through a randomly chosen corral gate.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="YahtzeeGame"><a href="#YahtzeeGame" class="headerlink" title="YahtzeeGame"></a>YahtzeeGame</h3><p>A YahtzeeGame instance is pretty simple: it encapsulates some configuration information (the number of dice, the maximum value on the die faces, and the number of rolls allowed in a round) along with a list of categories. There is no other state information required, since each category object keeps track of the score for that category. The method for returning the total game score just needs to iterate over the scoring categories to add things up.</p><p>One feature that may not be obvious is the method createNewHand(). This method constructs and returns a new Hand object that is based on the attributes of that particular game instance. This way, a client does not have to separately keep track of the number of dice, maximum value, or number of rolls; that information is only stored in the game object. See the UI for sample usage.</p><h3 id="GameFactory"><a href="#GameFactory" class="headerlink" title="GameFactory"></a>GameFactory</h3><p>(Note that the class GameFactory is already implemented. However, you can add to it as you wish for testing and experimentation.)<br>This class has some static methods for creating various games. You can take a look to see how the game constructor is used and how the categories are added to a YahtzeeGame object. This class is used in the sample UI.</p><p>Note that in the sample code, all the calls to the constructors of the Category implementations are commented out. That’s because this code won’t compile until you actually have implementations of the classes that are named there that are subtypes of Category.</p><p>As you complete the implementations, you can start uncommenting the constructor calls to try them out (and uncomment the import statements too).</p><h3 id="The-sample-code"><a href="#The-sample-code" class="headerlink" title="The sample code"></a>The sample code</h3><p>The sample code is an Eclipse project that you can import. See the instructions given for homework 2 if you don’t remember how to import a project.</p><p>There are “complete” skeletons present for Hand and YahtzeeGame classes in package hw3. (The Hand class has the toString method implemented for you already.) You will also find partial skeletons for the 8 required concrete subtypes of Category. Each of these classes has a descriptive javadoc comment and a stub for the required constructor. You will need to add either an implements or extends clause to each of these class declarations to make it a subtype of Category, and add whatever implementation code is necessary for your design, as discussed in the above section “Scoring Categories”.</p><h3 id="About-the-UI"><a href="#About-the-UI" class="headerlink" title="About the UI"></a>About the UI</h3><p>There is a sample user interface TextUIMain provided in the default (top-level) package of the sample code. This code will not run until you have implemented the YahtzeeGame and Hand classes, and you will not be able to play a game until you have started implementing the necessary categories. As you implement and test the categories, you can uncomment the corresponding constructors (and add appropriate import statements) in the GameFactory.</p><p>This is a text-based UI using clunky console I/O. It is not as slick as a graphical UI, but has the advantage that the code is entirely comprehensible, so you can read it to see how the other classes in the application are used. A typical screenshot of a game in progress is shown below.</p><p>The dashed lines in the second column indicate the categories called “Sixes” and “Three of a kind” are already filled, and the rightmost columns show the score and the list of dice for the hand that was used to fill the category. The “You rolled…” shows the current state of our hand. Since the parentheses are nonempty, this is not the first roll in this round. We must have previously chosen to “keep” the 2, 3, and 4 from the previous roll, and we just rolled a 1 and a 6. The second column in the list shows us what potential score we would get in each category for this roll as it stands (e.g. 30 points if we use it to fill the “Small Straight” category, or 16 points if we use it for the “Chance” category). One of our options might be to “keep” the 1 and reroll the 6 in the hope of getting a 5 (that would be a large straight).<br><figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

be reproducible while you are developing the code, and 2) to get a different game from the GameFactory. To try a different game from those constructed in the GameFactory, add another static method to GameFactory. (The “factory” keeps the UI from having any direct dependence on any of the specific category classes, so it will continue to work correctly even if you add new or different categories.)</p><h3 id="Testing-and-the-SpecChecker"><a href="#Testing-and-the-SpecChecker" class="headerlink" title="Testing and the SpecChecker"></a>Testing and the SpecChecker</h3><p>As always, you should try to work incrementally and write tests for your code as you develop it. Please do not put your test code in the hw3 package.</p><p>Do not rely on the UI code for testing! Trying to test your code using a UI is generally slow and unreliable. In particular, when we grade your work we are NOT going to run either of UIs, we are going to test that each method works according to its specification.<br>We will provide a basic SpecChecker, but it will not perform any functional tests of your code. At this point in the course, you are expected to be able to read the specfications, ask questions when things require clarification, and write your own unit tests.<br>Since the test code is not a required part of this assignment and does not need to be turned in, you are welcome to post your test code on Piazza for others to check, use and discuss.</p><p>The SpecChecker will verify the class names and packages, the public method names and return types, and the types of the parameters. If your class structure conforms to the spec, you should see a message similar to this in the console output:<br><figure class="highlight ada"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">x <span class="keyword">out</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> x tests pass.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Note that spec conformance can only be checked for the ten required classes listed at the beginning of this document that are known to the specchecker. Remember that your instance variables should always be declared private, and if you want to add any additional “helper” methods that are not specified, they must be declared private as well.</p><p>This SpecChecker will also offer to create a zip file for you. Note that it will look for the 10 required classes, and it will also zip up all other java files in your hw3 directory. Thus the archive should include any additional classes you added to your inheritance hierarchy, and should NOT include extraneous or unnecessary files such as your unit tests.</p><h3 id="Suggestions-for-getting-started"><a href="#Suggestions-for-getting-started" class="headerlink" title="Suggestions for getting started"></a>Suggestions for getting started</h3><ol><li>The YahtzeeGame class is very straightforward and doesn’t really depend on anything else you’re implementing. It should refer only to the interface Category.</li><li>Hand can also be developed and tested independently. You might start with the constructor that takes an int array, so you can specify starting values, and just implement the method getAll(). Your first attempt may not be sufficient for implementing all the other methods of Hand, but having this much will enable you to start on the scoring categories.</li><li>Although the scoring categories depend on Hand, they can be individually developed and tested with just a simplified, partial implementation of Hand. Within a given category class implementation, the only method of Hand you will need is getAll().</li><li>For the scoring categories, you might start with something like CountOccurrences. Add the clause implements Category and create stubs for the required methods. Write a couple of simple test case and start to implement the methods. (You may later move some of this code into an abstract superclass, but this is a good place to begin.)</li><li>As noted above, you can develop and test all the categories with just that minimal implementation of Hand. Of, course, at some point you’ll need to finish the rest of the Hand methods. As usual, start with some test cases and think about the expected behavior. Start with getAvailableDice(), getFixedDice(), and keep().</li><li>Note that the roll() method of Hand takes a Random as an argument. For testing, you can specify a Random with a known seed to make your test results reproducible.</li><li>Once you have YahtzeeGame, Hand, and CountOccurrences, you can uncomment the constructor in the createReallyTinyGame() method of the GameFactory. Then, you can run the UI and play the Really Tiny Game! Likewise, as you complete and test each of the scoring categories, uncomment the relevant constructor from one of the games in GameFactory and try it out.</li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>For this assignment you will implement a number of classes for an implementation of a dice game based on the game Yahtzee. The purposes of this assignment are:</p><ul><li>To use interfaces and inheritance in a realistic way</li><li>To give you a chance to make some design decisions related to inheritance</li><li>To give you more practice using arrays and ArrayLists</li></ul><h3 id="Summary-of-tasks"><a href="#Summary-of-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Summary of tasks"></a>Summary of tasks</h3><p>You will implement the following classes:<br><figure class="highlight ebnf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">YahtzeeGame</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Hand</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>plus, at a minimum, the following eight classes, all of which directly or indirectly implement the Category interface:<br><figure class="highlight ebnf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">AllButOneOfAKind</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">AllButTwoOfAKind</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">AllOfAKind</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Chance</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">CountOccurrences</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">FullHouse</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">LargeStraight</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">SmallStraight</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>All of your code goes in package hw3 . In addition to the classes listed above, you will implement whatever additional classes you decide are necessary in order to exploit inheritance to facilitate code reuse. See the discussion of scoring categories below for more information.</p><p>The exact definition of each of the eight category classes listed above can be found by reading the class javadoc.</p><h3 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h3><p>Yahtzee is normally played with five six-sided dice and a scorecard. One round consists of rolling the dice up to three times, and then filling one of the categories on the scorecard with a score. The score depends on both the criteria for the category and the actual dice values, and the player will normally choose an unfilled category so as to maximize the resulting score.</p><p>In our version of the game, the number of dice, the maximum value on the dice (i.e., the number of faces), the max number of rolls per round, and the types of categories on the scorecard, will all be configurable.</p><p>If you are not at all familiar with the game, don’t worry, it is not too complicated. Take a look at the Wikipedia page for an overview, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee</a></p><p>Note that our version of the game does not include several features described on Wikipedia or in the traditional versions of the game. In particular, we do not distinguish the “upper section” and “lower section” categories, there is no bonus for the “upper section”, there is no special bonus for a second Yahtzee, and there are no jokers.</p><p>The two key abstractions in the design are hands and scoring categories.</p><h3 id="Hands"><a href="#Hands" class="headerlink" title="Hands"></a>Hands</h3><p>A hand, represented by the Hand class that you will implement, is a basically a list of integers representing the current states of all the dice (in the traditional game there would be 5 numbers with possible values 1 through 6). However, the dice are partitioned into two lists: available dice and fixed dice. Initially, all dice are available. When the dice are “rolled”, random values in the appropriate range are generated for the available dice only; the fixed values are not modified. If the maximum number of rolls has not yet been reached, the player can choose to “keep” some of the current available dice values, which means they are moved to the fixed list so they won’t be modified by the next roll. Likewise, the player can choose to “free” any of the fixed values, so they will be re-rolled. Note that in this design, an individual die isn’t represented by a special type of object; a die value is just an integer. All methods that return arrays containing dice values must return the values in ascending order.</p><p>After the maximum number of rolls is reached, all dice are automatically moved to the fixed list and the hand can no longer be modified. A new hand must be created for the next round.</p><p>See the javadoc for details. Also note that the client normally obtains a new Hand using the method createNewHand in the YahtzeeGame class, not by calling the constructor directly. (You can see how this works by reading at the doOneTurn() method of the sample UI.)</p><p>Hand example. Suppose we display a dice group as a string by listing first the available dice and then the fixed dice in parentheses. For example, in a game with 5 dice, after the first roll we might see the values such as this:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">2 </span><span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">6</span> ()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Depending on which scoring categories you need to fill, you might decide to keep 2, 3, and 4 (perhaps in the hope of completing a straight). Now you have<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">3 </span><span class="number">6</span> (<span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">4</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>On the next roll, the 6 and the other 3 are then replaced by random values, but the 2, 3, and 4 you selected remain fixed. If (for example) you now roll a 2 and a 5, you would have<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">2 </span><span class="number">5</span> (<span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">4</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>At this point you could choose to keep the 5 (to make a small straight, maybe hoping the next roll will give you a large straight). Now you have<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">2 </span>(<span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">5</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>In the traditional game, you get a maximum of three rolls; in that case if you (for example) rolled a 4, you’d end up with<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">(<span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">5</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>That is, when you reach the maximum number of rolls, all dice are automatically fixed. Once all dice are fixed, we say the hand is complete. At this point in the game, the player chooses one of the scoring categories and uses the completed hand to fill that category.</p><h3 id="Scoring-categories"><a href="#Scoring-categories" class="headerlink" title="Scoring categories"></a>Scoring categories</h3><p>A scoring category represents one row of the score sheet. A category object stores the actual score for that category along with the hand that was used to fill the category. A given category object also contains the algorithms needed to a) determine whether a given hand satisfies the criteria defined for the category (e.g., is it a straight, or three-of-a-kind, or whatever), and b) determine what the potential score would be for a given hand, if it were used to fill that category.</p><p>There are many different possible categories, each with its own particular algorithms. For example, the traditional game has a three-of-a-kind category: a hand satisfies the category if it contains any three numbers that are the same, and it is scored by summing the values of all the dice. The traditional game also has a “large straight” category: a hand satisfies the category if it has 5 consecutive values, and it always receives a fixed score of 40.</p><p>This is where polymorphism becomes useful. The client using this code (e.g., think of the client as the text-based UI provided in the sample code) does not care about the details of what the categories are or how each category calculates its score. The client just needs to be able to invoke methods on a category to find out whether a given dice group satisfies it, what the score would be, and to inform the category when it has been selected to be filled by a given hand.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>In this assignment you will have the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned this semester about programming to an actual problem and actual data. For this assignment we will use social media data collected during the 2014 Carlton Complex Wildfire in Eastern Washington State. This data set was part of my dissertation research on the integration of public social media communication into emergency response.</p><p>The development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has changed how members of the public communicate and share information with each other during crisis and disaster events. Researchers in the field of crisis informatics look at social media communications for insight into how these technologies are reshaping the information space surrounding a disaster and provide new ways for the public to participate in both sharing of information and response. My research focuses on the challenges faced by emergency responders as they work to leverage these channels as part of their emergency communications plan and also the solutions being developed to support the monitoring of an often complex and unwieldy information space as events unfold.<br>I work with an innovative group of emergency responders who are part of the social media in emergency management community (SMEM) that have pioneered a new form of digital volunteerism within the emergency response community called a Virtual Operational Support Team (VOST). Members of VOST teams have a mix of social media communication skills and training in public information work and emergency response protocols. During a disaster, a VOST team extends the resources of the emergency response team on the ground coordinating public social media communications and gathering relevant situational awareness information for the incident management team.</p><p>This dataset was taken from the 2014 Carlton Complex Wildfire. The fire started on July 14th, when a lightning storm moved through the Methow Valley in Eastern Washington State. On July 17th, adverse weather conditions caused the fire to grow explosively overnight from approximately forty-nine thousand acres to over a hundred and fifty thousand acres. This rate of fire growth is somewhat unprecedented and the fires burned through the towns of Pateros and Twisp resulting in large-scale evacuations and the destruction of over 300 homes. The fire also destroyed critical infrastructure resulting in widespread power and cellular outages in many place for over a week. The data set for this fire starts on July 17th when Portland NIMO, a federal Type I team, was assigned to the fire and the NIMO VOST was activated until July 27th when the team stood down. The fire ultimately grew to 256 thousand acres making it the largest wildfire in Washington State history (eclipsed by the 2015 Okanogan Complex in the same area a year later).<br>As a researcher on CU’s Project EPIC, my role on the VOST was to provide analytical support to the public information team on the ground using data collected through the Twitter API. I developed Python scripts that expanded the links to embedded content and massaged the data in useful ways for analysis in Tableau, a data visualization tool. At the end of each day, I worked on a comprehensive summary that was forwarded to the public information team as a reference for the morning briefing the following day.</p><p>Twitter is a particularly interesting platform for analysis during a disaster because the Twitter stream can show you what is relevant in the moment across a wide variety of sources. The ability to retweet information reinforces its currency and acts as recommendation to others in a Twitterer’s network or following the conversation. In addition, the ability to embed links and media provides visibility to what is being shared across multiple social media platforms simultaneously.</p><h3 id="Data-Set-Description"><a href="#Data-Set-Description" class="headerlink" title="Data Set Description"></a>Data Set Description</h3><p>The full dataset for this fire contains over 24 thousand tweets and related information. I hava created multiple data extract files from this dataset so that you can work with information on a more manageable scale.</p><p>As part of the analysis, we coded the most commonly occurring sources of information (Twitter accounts and URL domains) using the following values:</p><h3 id="Tweet-extracts"><a href="#Tweet-extracts" class="headerlink" title="Tweet extracts"></a>Tweet extracts</h3><p>Each row in the tweet extracts is an individual tweet and contains the following columns:</p><h3 id="A-final-message"><a href="#A-final-message" class="headerlink" title="A final message"></a>A final message</h3><p>After the user selects No, and you exit your loop, you need to print another message to the user. In this message, briefly explain the easiest, hardest, and most and least enjoyable portions of this project. Then, exit the program.</p><h2 id="Implementation-Details-Technical-Requirements"><a href="#Implementation-Details-Technical-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details/ Technical Requirements"></a>Implementation Details/ Technical Requirements</h2><h3 id="Store-data-from-the-files-in-an-object"><a href="#Store-data-from-the-files-in-an-object" class="headerlink" title="Store data from the files in an object"></a>Store data from the files in an object</h3><p>Your program needs to have at least one class. A technical requirement of this project is that you create a class to support the functionality of the program. The class(es) you create will depend on the problem and data you are working with. For instance, if you are working with individual tweets you may need a Tweet class. If you are working geocoded tweets you may also want a Geocode class that stores the latitude /longitude data.</p><p>The first thing your program needs to do, even before displaying the welcome message, is input the data from the txt files. Data should be read in from the files and stored in the appropriate variable in your class to support what your program does. You should structure your program to read in all data only one time.</p><h3 id="Other-requirements"><a href="#Other-requirements" class="headerlink" title="Other requirements:"></a>Other requirements:</h3><ol><li>All variables in your class need to be private and accessed through public methods. For example, if one of the class variables is latitude then you will need getLatitude() and setLatitude() methods.</li><li>You need at least three objects. For example if you create a class Tweet, then you need at least three instances of Tweet in your program.</li><li>You are welcome to generate new data files to support your program’s functionality. For example, if you are working with the URL domains extract, you may want to limit your analysis to domains that occur at least 25 times. The data in these sub-extracts is sorted by count, so you can import the .csv file into Excel and delete the rows that fall below 25. You can also write a program or talk to us about the specific slice of data you are interested in.</li><li>If you store data in an array, you can create an array that is larger than you need and leave some of it unused. Look at the arrays in the AppleFarmer class for an example of what you might do for this assignment. You will need to keep track of how much ofthe array is used. The technique for doing this is the same as using the Curren tDay variable in AppleFarmer.</li><li>The easiest way to read the .csv files is to use getline() for each line in the file and then use stringstream to parse the line. 6. There are examples of how to do both of these things in notes provided on the Moodle.</li><li>When you submit your program, include all data files you used in your project directory.</li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Ploblem"><a href="#Ploblem" class="headerlink" title="Ploblem"></a>Ploblem</h3><p>Blackout Math is a puzzle in which you are given an incorrect arithmetic equation, such as this one:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">288 </span>/ <span class="number">24</span> × <span class="number">6</span> = <span class="number">18</span> × <span class="number">13</span> × <span class="number">8</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>To solve the puzzle, figure out which two squares must be blacked out to create a correct equation. Blacked out squares are simply skipped over when reading the new equation. Note that you can choose to black out an operation — for example, if you black out the last multiplication sign, the right side would read 18 x 138. You are not allowed to black out the equal sign!<br>In this particular instance of the puzzle, the answer is as follows:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">288 </span>/ <span class="number">4</span> × <span class="number">6</span> = <span class="number">18</span> × <span class="number">3</span> × <span class="number">8</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>as both sides of the equation now evaluate to 432.<br>Here is another puzzle for you to try:<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">168 </span>/ <span class="number">24</span> + <span class="number">8</span> = <span class="number">11</span> × <span class="number">3</span> - <span class="number">16</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>In this project, you will develop a program that reads in Blackout Math puzzles from a file and determines their solutions.</p><h3 id="Building-your-solution"><a href="#Building-your-solution" class="headerlink" title="Building your solution"></a>Building your solution</h3><p>Once your solution is complete, it will work as follows:<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Open up <span class="keyword">a</span> <span class="built_in">file</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> Blackout Math puzzles</span><br><span class="line">  For <span class="keyword">each</span> puzzle:</span><br><span class="line">    For <span class="keyword">each</span> possible pair <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">characters</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> puzzle</span><br><span class="line">      Determine <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> that results <span class="built_in">from</span> deleting those <span class="keyword">characters</span></span><br><span class="line">      Compute <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="built_in">value</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">each</span> side <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> equation</span><br><span class="line">      If <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="literal">two</span> sides have <span class="keyword">the</span> same <span class="built_in">value</span>, success!</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>However, it will be easier to build your solution from the inside out — that is, first create a function that computes the value of one side of one equation, then use that to build a checker for a single puzzle, and so on. Here we will give you some hints for how to complete this process.</p><h3 id="Computing-the-value-of-an-expression"><a href="#Computing-the-value-of-an-expression" class="headerlink" title="Computing the value of an expression"></a>Computing the value of an expression</h3><p>Consider the following string: 5 × 2 + 3 – going from left to right, your program will have to check whether each character represents a digit or an operation, and keep a running total of the current value of the expression. Also note that when you come to a number, you have to remember what the last character was – knowing only that the current character is a 3 only helps if you know that you were supposed to add it to the previous value of the expression! The Python function isdigit will be helpful for this process. To get started, write a skeleton of a compute function that takes a string and goes through it character by character, converting the numbers to ints and printing “add”, “subtract”, “multiply” or “divide” for each operation as they are encountered.</p><p>Now, consider the expression 5 + 2 × 3 – if we parse this string from left to right (as we would usually process it in a loop), we will get 21, but according to the standard order of operations, we should do the multiplication first, then the addition, to get 11. In effect, when going left-to-right, we need to delay the addition until the multiplication has been completed. One way to do that is to save the addition on a stack, then pop it off the stack and execute it once the multiplication has finished. You also need to save the numbers themselves on a separate stack until they are needed. Of course, if you have multiple additions or subtractions in a row, then you need to only save the last one, so when you see a second addition or subtraction, you need to compute the result of the first before saving the result and the most recent operation.</p><p>If we have parentheses as well, this also can be easily handled with a stack, again essentially forcing the contents of the parentheses to happen first.</p><p>The pseudocode for handling order-of-operations (for just the four standard operations plus parentheses) using a pair of stacks is as follows:<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span

class="built_in">number</span> stack</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>To get a feel for how and why this works, trace this pseudocode for the input 2 + 5 × (6 - 3) - 6 by noting what is in each stack after reading each character.</p><p>Finally, consider the string 5 × 12 + 3 – in this case, when you come to a number, you cannot count on it being immediately used. Instead, you have to continue building up the value of the current number until you read an operation, then you can incorporate that into the expression. Figure out what happens when the 1 is read by your function, then the 2, and finally the +. Modify your compute function to handle the case of multi-digit numbers. As above, trace the correct execution on paper and then test the code on a few different cases.</p><h3 id="Error-handling"><a href="#Error-handling" class="headerlink" title="Error handling"></a>Error handling</h3><p>In many cases in this course, we do not worry about handling errors in input as they are not critical to the problem at hand. However, in this case, we can expect “errors” to occur when parsing. This is because we will be deleting arbitrary characters from the puzzle. For example, when trying to solve our first example 288 / 24 × 6=18 × 13 × 8 we might try deleting the 6, leaving a left side of 288 / 24×. We know right away that this is not a possible solution to the puzzle, but our compute function must still handle this gracefully. Luckily, the stack-based algorithm will handle most of these cases easily – if we get to the end of the input and have anything other than one number and no operators left, there was erroneous input. Other error cases that you may discover can also be dealt with via the parsing algorithm itself.</p><h3 id="Testing-whether-an-equation-is-correct"><a href="#Testing-whether-an-equation-is-correct" class="headerlink" title="Testing whether an equation is correct"></a>Testing whether an equation is correct</h3><p>Once we can evaluate a single expression, it is simple to compute whether two sides of an equation are equal. You may find the Python functions find (with slicing) or split useful to locate the equal sign in your equation (if it still has one!). Write a function called test that takes in a string and uses your compute function to decide if the string represents the correct solution to a Blackout Math puzzle.</p><h3 id="Computing-all-possible-pairs-of-characters"><a href="#Computing-all-possible-pairs-of-characters" class="headerlink" title="Computing all possible pairs of characters"></a>Computing all possible pairs of characters</h3><p>To solve a Blackout Math puzzle, you have to find the two squares to black out, or in our case, two characters to remove from the string. For a computer, the simplest thing to do is simply to test all possible pairs of characters. Note that although the two examples in this writeup are the same length, not all Blackout Math puzzles will be.</p><p>Write a function solve that takes in a full Blackout Math puzzle as a string and loops through all possible pairs of characters. For each pair of characters, create the string that results when those two characters are removed, and use your evaluate function to see which of those represents the solution! This is a good time to make sure that your error handling works, as this loop will send many malformed equations to your evaluate function – consider how compute will report errors, and how evaluate will handle them. Remember, that the two characters that are removed COULD be on the same side of the equals sign.</p><h3 id="Using-a-binary-tree-to-compute-all-possible-solutions"><a href="#Using-a-binary-tree-to-compute-all-possible-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Using a binary tree to compute all possible solutions"></a>Using a binary tree to compute all possible solutions</h3><p>Now that you have done this for all possible combinations of two blacked out characters, you need to now do it for any arbitrary number of blacked out characters.</p><p>To do this you are required to use a binary tree. The tree will be structured such that all leaf nodes of the tree are all possible combinations of blacked out characters.</p><p>The left child of the tree will be the equation with the current character blacked out. The right child will be the equation with the current character not blacked out.</p><p>To construct the tree you will consider one character at a time in the equation. You will make two children, one with the current value blacked out and one with the value not blacked out. Each level of the tree will represent all possible combinations of a new character character being added to the statement.</p><p>Your function for making the tree will be recursive in nature, as recursion is the easiest way to process a binary tree.<br>Psuedocode for making the tree:<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">def makeTree( equation, <span class="built_in">value</span> ):</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> equation is <span class="literal">empty</span>, we have reached <span class="keyword">the</span> leaves <span class="keyword">of</span> this branch:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">set</span> left <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="literal">right</span> children <span class="built_in">to</span> None</span><br><span class="line">  otherwise:</span><br><span class="line">    we need <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="built_in">create</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> left <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="literal">right</span> children:</span><br><span class="line">    - left will be <span class="keyword">a</span> recursive call <span class="built_in">to</span> make tree <span class="keyword">with</span>:</span><br><span class="line">      - <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="keyword">first</span> <span class="keyword">character</span> removed <span class="built_in">from</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> equation</span><br><span class="line">      - <span class="keyword">the</span> same <span class="built_in">value</span></span><br><span class="line">    - <span class="literal">right</span> will be <span class="keyword">a</span> recursive call <span class="built_in">to</span> make tree <span class="keyword">with</span>:</span><br><span class="line">      - <span class="keyword">the</span> equation <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="keyword">first</span> <span class="keyword">character</span> removed</span><br><span class="line">      - <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="keyword">first</span> <span class="keyword">character</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> equation appended <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> <span class="built_in">value</span></span><br><span class="line">  make <span class="keyword">a</span> binary tree node <span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> left, <span class="literal">right</span>, <span class="keyword">and</span> current <span class="built_in">value</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="literal">return</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> binary tree node</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>In the case of the tree presented above, there are no valid solutions. These trees can get large. There are actually 2 n possible leaf nodes, where n is the length of the equation. For example, the equation 3 + 2 / 5 = 5 + 3 × 2 will have 2 11 possible leaf nodes. That’s 2048 leaf nodes!</p><h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>As you develop your solution, make sure to thoroughly test each function as well as the overall solution. For the compute function, it probably makes sense to test simple expressions first, then more complex ones (including parentheses), and finally ones that will cause errors of various kinds.</p><p>For the overall solution, you should test some different puzzles including some of your own creation (making a puzzle isn’t that hard!). Make sure that your code works for all the puzzles – but we will not test with any puzzle that does not have a solution. Note that some puzzles, such as the one given at the top of this assignment, do not rely on order of operations, so can be used for testing whether or not you have implemented that algorithm.</p>]]></content>

Do not use the input files directly from studres or your home folder as this will exhaust the network.</p><p>Your program should perform the following operations:</p><ul><li>Obtain the absolute paths of the input and output directories from the user. The input must be read in from files in the input directory, and must be written to files in the output directory.</li><li>Find all character level or word level n-grams for text fragments contained within files in the given input directory written in a given language, depending on the user’s input</li><li>Print the list of n-grams and their frequency to a file in the output directory, in alphabetical order</li></ul><p>Your program should deal gracefully with possible errors such as the web resource file being unavailable, or the response containing data in an unexpected format. The source code for your program should follow common style guidelines, including:</p><ol><li>formatting code neatly</li><li>consistency in name formats for methods, fields, variables</li><li>avoiding embedded “magic numbers” and string literals</li><li>minimising code duplication</li><li>avoiding long methods</li><li>using comments and informative method/variable names to make the code clear to the reader</li></ol><h3 id="Deliverables"><a href="#Deliverables" class="headerlink" title="Deliverables"></a>Deliverables</h3><p>Hand in via MMS, a zip file containing the following:</p><p>Your Java source files</p><ul><li>A brief report (maximum 3 pages) explaining the decisions you made, how you tested your program, and how you solved any difficulties that you encountered. Include instructions on how to run your program and any dependencies that need resolving. You can use any software you like to write your report, but your submitted version must be in PDF format.</li><li>Also within your report:</li><li>Highlight one piece of feedback from your previous submissions, and explain how you used it to improve this submission</li><li>If you had to carry out a similar large-scale data processing task in future, would you choose Hadoop or basic file manipulation as you did in earlier practicals? Write a brief comparison of the two methods, explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each, and justify your choice.</li></ul><h3 id="Extensions"><a href="#Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Extensions"></a>Extensions</h3><p>If you wish to experiment further, you could try any or all of the following:</p><ol><li>Give the user an option to order the n-grams by occurrence frequency. Hint: You could use the ‘Most Popular Word’ example on studres as a starting point.</li><li>Perform additional queries on the data, such as:<ol start="2"><li>a. Count all text fragments containing a given string by the user in a given language</li><li>b. Find which word occurs in the highest number of different languages</li><li>c. Any other additional statistics/queries about the data you could generate using Hadoop</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="Hints"><a href="#Hints" class="headerlink" title="Hints"></a>Hints</h3><p>Here is one possible sequence for developing your solution. It is recommended that you make a new method or class at each stage, so that you can easily go back to a previous stage if you run into problems. Please use demonstrator support in the labs whenever possible.</p><ol><li>You will need to examine the structure of the data files, to see how the text fragments and language specifications are represented.</li><li>Tackle one problem at a time, beginning with selecting all text in a particular language, which requires a mapper class but no reducer. Initially, you can use a fixed search language String in your mapper class for testing purposes.</li><li>To select only text in the required language, the difficulty is that the language is recorded in a different line from the text fragment, so will be processed in a different call to map. This can be solved using a field in the mapper object to record the most recently encountered language. The map method can then either update this field, if the current line contains a language, or check the language field value, if the current line contains a text fragment.</li><li>To test, first make a new directory and copy 10 or 20 of the data files into it—the full data set will take inconveniently long to run.</li><li>Once this works, refine your solution so that the search language is passed as a parameter. Recall that you can pass a parameter value to a mapper or reducer by calling the method.</li><li>To return text in the specified language as n-grams, you will need to also pass the user’s specified n-gram type and size as parameters, using the same methods in Step 5. Following this, it is recommended that you reuse your n-gram creation code from Practical 2 to split each String into its corresponding n-grams. Remember that, unlike Practical 2, you do not need to represent word boundaries with an underscore.</li><li>In order to output the n-gram frequencies alongside the n-grams themselves, you will need to implement a reducer class that groups duplicate n-grams and sums their total frequency. For a reminder of how to do this, review the ‘Word Count’ example on studres.</li><li>For ordering your output n-grams, recall that sorting order is specified with the setOutputKeyComparatorClass method of the JobConf class.</li></ol>]]></content>

(Plus I had to hand edit the file to make it parseable)</li><li>Fortunately, Python is great for untangling and manipulating data.</li><li>Write a generator that reads from the given url over the network, and produces a summary line for a year’s data on each ‘next’ call</li><li>remember that urllib.request returns ‘bytes arrays’, not strings</li><li>The generator should read the lines of the oil2.txt file in a lazy fashion - it should only read 13 lines for every two years of output. Note a loop can have any number of ‘yield’ calls in it.</li><li>Ignore the monthly data, just extract the yearly info</li><li>Drop the month column</li><li>In addition to the ‘oil’ generator function, my solution had a separate helper function, ‘def makeCSV- Line(year, data):’</li></ul><h3 id="Here-is-the-first-two-years-of-data-2014-and-2013"><a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Description"><a href="#Description" class="headerlink" title="Description"></a>Description</h3><p>You will develop a web-based application with a database back-end for storage and retrieval of data. Choose your own adventure: select a subject matter related to your major or personal interests.</p><h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>Some recent CS108 projects have included:</p><ul><li>Interactive dictionary for English/Junta language translation</li><li>Inventory system for chemistry lab / reactive agents</li><li>Social network for a gardening club</li><li>High school basketball win/loss records &amp; standings</li><li>Fisheries information tracking endangered species</li><li>Geographic information system for archeology dig</li><li>Compact disc inventory and sales</li><li>Calorie counting database/user interface</li><li>Local artists list their works for sale (with pictures)</li><li>Car rental and return</li><li>Special of the day listing for restaurant</li></ul><h3 id="Detailed-Requirements"><a href="#Detailed-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Requirements"></a>Detailed Requirements</h3><p>You should begin by picking a concrete but simple interaction and modeling the data and functionality to implement it. For example, in a car rental application you might show a list of cars and allow a customer to complete a rental for one car. Start small; you can always add more interactions and details after you get the first one working.</p><p>Your application will model some kind of useful function, with a web-based interface (HTML) and data storage in a relational database (MySQL). A single interaction might be sufficient for this project, but a single web page certainly is not. You should have multiple web pages with logical transitions between the pages using buttons or links.</p><p>Projects must demonstrate reading from, inserting into, and updating database tables from your web interface. Points will be awarded for the general complexity of the project, with more complex projects scoring higher than very simple projects that mimic in-class assignments. After your work is functionally complete, you should enhance the look and feel of the application as the aesthetics (colors, images and fonts) will count for a small portion of your grade.</p><h3 id="Topic-Proposal"><a href="#Topic-Proposal" class="headerlink" title="Topic Proposal"></a>Topic Proposal</h3><p>Your proposal should be brief (about 3 sentences) and describe the general subject matter (e.g., car rental), the specific interaction you will model (e.g. car selection and checkout) and the data you will require for this interaction (e.g., table of cars, table of customers, table of rentals which matches cars with customers).</p><h3 id="Data-Requirements"><a href="#Data-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Data Requirements"></a>Data Requirements</h3><p>What kind of data will your application need to interact with? Describe the data in terms of records and fields. What attributes does each record need to have? How will you uniquely identify a record?</p><p>Make up some sample data (about 5 records) so that you can use to begin thinking about and testing the program’s interactions. You might want to use a spreadsheet program like Excel to create these records, which will also enable importing them into the database later. We will demonstrate how to create tables and records in MySQL at the scheduled lab session this week.</p><h3 id="Planning-Your-Time"><a href="#Planning-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Planning Your Time"></a>Planning Your Time</h3><p>You have 4 weeks to complete this project. Here are some guidelines on what you should be working on at what time:</p><h3 id="roject-Demonstration-Video"><a href="#roject-Demonstration-Video" class="headerlink" title="roject Demonstration Video"></a>roject Demonstration Video</h3><p>You will present your project by making a short (2-3 minute) video screen capture, with you narrating as you demonstrate the application. Think about this as a demonstration for a potential customer or employer. This will speed the grading, and provide you with a lasting artifact of your work, which you can demonstrate to potential employers. Your demonstration should not show any code or database records, but must demonstrate every major feature of your application.</p><p>I recommend that you write a brief outline of what you will show in which order. Then, use a screen capture tool (I suggest QuickTime player for Mac or Tiny Take for Windows or any similar program). Record your video, and post it to YouTube (a private/unlisted URL is fine).</p>]]></content>

The following tasks should be done in a plain text editor and saved as .html, .php, .css, or .js files where appropriate. You should then copy these files to DEVWEB. If you use Linux or Unix, go to the DEVWEB directory then to the 2015 directory (if you do not have a 2015 directory you will have to create one). If you put a file called ex.html in that directory you can view it in your web browser from any internet connected computer.</p><p>If you use Windows on any of the Departmental machines you will find the DEVWEB folder mapped to your Q: drive.</p><p>These exercises are worth up to 10% of the overall mark for CS 952 Database and Web Systems Development.</p><h3 id="Submission"><a href="#Submission" class="headerlink" title="Submission"></a>Submission</h3><p>Please note that some of the later questions ask you to build on your solutions to earlier questions. You should therefore make sure that you save your solution to each question in separate files and that you do not overwrite your earlier solutions. For example, the solution file for question one could be named q1.html, the solution files for question 2 could be named q2.html (this will be a modified version of q1.html) and q2.php, the solution files for question 3 could be named q3.html (this will be a modified version of q1.html or q2.html) and q3.php (this will be a modified version of q2.php). The files that you create for each question should be placed in a directory or folder which you should zip and upload via Myplace.</p><p>This is an individual exercise: any copying of code (except from the lecture notes or the W3Schools website) may result in disciplinary measures.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h3><p>For as long as people have been able to write they have tried to find ways to send messages secretly by hiding the message in some way. One way of encrypting a message is to hide it inside some other text. It works as follows: you and the intended message recipient both agree on a (large) piece of source text, such as a passage from a book, which you don’t share with anyone else. You then find a character position for each letter in your (much shorter) message within the larger piece of text, and send the list of positions. Here’s an example:<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Source <span class="keyword">text</span> (secret): The quick brown fox jumps over <span class="keyword">the</span> lazy dog</span><br><span class="line">Message <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="built_in">encrypt</span>: bread</span><br><span class="line">Encrypted message: <span class="number">10</span> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">36</span> <span class="number">40</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Of course, we could have taken alternative positions for ‘e’ (also found at positions 28 and 33) and ‘r’ (also at 29), but in this cipher we’ll always use the first occurrence of a letter.<br>If you look closely at the secret text above you’ll notice that it contains every letter in the English alphabet, which means we can encrypt any message we want (note we’ll be restricting ourselves to messages that do not contain spaces in this assignment). While this is likely to be true of any sufficiently long piece of text, what should we do if the message contains a letter not found in the secret text? In the absence of any valid substitute, let’s use 1 to indicate that it wasn’t found.

Call your class SentenceCipher (that is, the source code will be in a file called SentenceCipher.java). If you choose to use an IDE other than DrJava, ensure that your program is not defined in a package (there should be no package statement at the top of the file).</p><p>When your assignment is complete, a user running your program will be prompted to enter the shared ‘source’ text, then asked if they want to encrypt or decrypt a message. The source text may contain any mixture of characters, including punctuation and spaces. Before continuing, the source text must be converted to all lower case.</p><p>After receiving the source text from the user, they will be asked to choose one of two options:</p><ol><li>Encrypt a message</li><li>Decrypt a message</li></ol><p>Note that both options finish by displaying the amount of information loss.</p><p>The three development and testing stages defined below will step you through creating a functioning cipher tool. You do not need to follow these suggested development stages, but if you do then a testing tool will be available that can run your partiallycompleted program with lots of different inputs and indicate when it works as expected and when it does not.</p><h3 id="General-guidance"><a href="#General-guidance" class="headerlink" title="General guidance"></a>General guidance</h3><p>Use the Scanner class (import it from the java.util package) to read the user’s input.</p><p>Your program will need to declare appropriate variables for holding the source text, user’s processing choice, and (for encryption) the word to be encrypted. Several other temporary variables will be needed.</p><p>Use constants to hold sensible default values and any special values that will be used repeatedly.</p><h3 id="Example-Sessions"><a href="#Example-Sessions" class="headerlink" title="Example Sessions"></a>Example Sessions</h3><p>In these example sessions the user’s input is highlighted. All other text is produced by the program.<br><figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Sentence Cipher</span><br><span class="line">Enter source text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Select</span> a cipher <span class="keyword">option</span>:</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">1.</span> <span class="keyword">Encrypt</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2.</span> <span class="keyword">Decrypt</span></span><br><span class="line">Choice: <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">Enter word <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">encrypt</span>: bread</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Result</span>: <span class="number">10</span> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">36</span> <span class="number">40</span> ‐<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">Information loss (%): <span class="number">0.0</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Sentence Cipher</span><br><span class="line">Enter <span class="keyword">source</span> <span class="built_in">text</span>: The <span class="keyword">quick</span> brown fox jumps</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Select</span> a cipher <span class="keyword">option</span>:</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">1.</span> <span class="keyword">Encrypt</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2.</span> <span class="keyword">Decrypt</span></span><br><span class="line">Choice: <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">Enter word <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">encrypt</span>: tea</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Result</span>: <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">2</span> ‐<span class="number">1</span> ‐<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">Information loss (%): <span class="number">33.33333333333333</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Sentence Cipher</span><br><span class="line">Enter <span class="keyword">source</span> <span class="built_in">text</span>: The <span class="keyword">quick</span> brown fox jumps</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Select</span> a cipher <span class="keyword">option</span>:</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">1.</span> <span class="keyword">Encrypt</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2.</span> <span class="keyword">Decrypt</span></span><br><span class="line">Choice: <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">Enter positions (‐<span class="number">2</span> <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">end</span>): <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">2</span> ‐<span class="number">1</span> ‐<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Result</span>: te_</span><br><span class="line">Information loss (%): <span class="number">33.33333333333333</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>which is identical to if the user pressed Enter between each position (no change to your program will be necessary)</p><h3 id="Development-Stages"><a href="#Development-Stages" class="headerlink" title="Development Stages"></a>Development Stages</h3><p>The three assignment stages take you through developing: a program that can encrypt or decrypt a single character; a program that can encrypt and decrypt an entire word; and finally a program that can process an entire word and report on characters that could not be encrypted or decrypted and invalid positions given during decryption.
