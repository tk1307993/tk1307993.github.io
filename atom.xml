    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of this assignment is to assess your understanding of</p><ul><li>Encapsulation in functions</li><li>Namespaces: global vs local</li><li>Exception handling</li><li>Program modularity<br>Next week, we will continue with chapter 10 recursion.</li></ul><h3 id="Submission"><a href="#Submission" class="headerlink" title="Submission"></a>Submission</h3><ul><li>Include your full name as a comment on the first line of your Python program.</li><li>Submit (upload) to the dropbox one file labeled as YourName_HW7.py</li></ul><h3 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem"></a>Problem</h3><p>You are to simulate a simple ATM machine. An account holder (user) should be able to enter their pin number and select from a menu of transactions: Deposit, Withdraw, Balance or Quit. You are to assume that the user has only one account on which these transactions can be performed. This account is associated with the user’s pin number. The ATM should properly and regularly communicate with the user. The ATM should get information on current account information from a file. An accounts.txt file is posted with this assignment. Examine the structure of each line of the file which contains a 4-digit code, first and last names, and the current account balance.</p><h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>Note: whenever I use ‘Code the exception’, this means you need to include code in a ‘try’ block to catch the exception caused by a runtime error.<br>You may not use global variables; all variables must be local.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p>Write a function startUp(fname) that takes as input a filename that contains the account holder information and current balance. The file should be read and the data stored in a dictionary with the pin as the key and the remaining information as the value.<br>Note: the current balance is a float data type. Do an explicit conversion to float on that list item. Code an exception (‘Cannot get to the file’). The function should return two values: Boolean, dictionary; for example: if you named your dictionary, daccts, and the file was successfully read and the dictionary successfully created, then return (True, daccts); if the file was not successfully read, return (False, daccts).</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p>Write a function getUser(proceed, dictionary) that takes as input a Boolean value and the dictionary you created in startUp. Prompt the user to enter a pin number. If the pin is valid, the function should return (user, proceed), where user is the dictionary key value; if the pin is invalid, print (‘Incorrect pin’) and return (None, False).</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Write a function menu(name) that takes as input the user’s first name, greets the user and displays the menu options: 1. Deposit, 2: Withdraw, 3.Check Balance, 4. Quit. If the user enters an invalid value (i.e. not 1, 2, 3 or 4) display the menu option again and give the user a chance to enter a value again. Once a valid number is entered, the function should return the number of the chosen option.</p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p>Write a function getAmount() that takes no input. Inside a loop, prompt the user for an amount to be either deposited or withdrawn, at this point it does not matter which it is. The amount must be converted to float. Code an exception (‘You entered an incorrect amount. Please try again’). An interruption would be caused if the user enters a string instead of a numeric value, or presses the enter key without entering anything. Stay in the loop until a valid number is entered and return amount.</p><h4 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h4><p>Write a function deposit(balance) that takes as input the user’s account balance. The function calls getAmount(), calculates and displays the new balance. The function returns the new balance.</p><h4 id="Step-6"><a href="#Step-6" class="headerlink" title="Step 6"></a>Step 6</h4><p>Write a function withdraw(balance) that takes as input the user’s account balance. The function calls getAmount(). If the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the balance display (‘Insufficient funds to complete the transaction’). The user should be prompted to enter a new amount, until the amount entered is less than the balance. The function calculates and displays the new balance. The function returns the new balance.</p><h4 id="Step-7"><a href="#Step-7" class="headerlink" title="Step 7"></a>Step 7</h4><p>Write a function balance(name, balance) that takes as input the user’s name and balance and prints the message ‘Your current balance is $xxxx.xx’ where xxxx.xx is the current balance amount. This function does not return a value.</p><h4 id="Step-8"><a href="#Step-8" class="headerlink" title="Step 8"></a>Step 8</h4><p>Write a function main() that will control the flow of your program. You will build this code as you continue to create functions. main() should call startup, getUser and menu. It should contain a loop that determines which transaction the user has chosen to process and allows the user to process as many transactions as desired.</p><ul><li>If the user chooses to make a deposit, the deposit function is called and the dictionary is updated with the returned balance.</li><li>If the user chooses to make a withdrawal, the withdraw function is called and the dictionary is updated with the returned balance.</li><li>If the user chooses to check the account balance, the balance function is called.</li><li>If the user chooses to quit, exit the loop and print (‘Goodbye’). Once, the user quits, the program should terminate. Note: suggestion - use a Boolean data type to determine when the loop should terminate</li></ul><h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>The following is only one test case. You should do several test cases to evaluate all the exceptions you have coded and other possible data entry errors.</p><p>Sample execution:<br><figure class="highlight ldif"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Welcome -- Please enter your pin number 4466</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Kay :</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">1</span>: Deposit</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">2</span>: Withdrawal</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">3</span>: Check Balance</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">4</span>: Quit</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Enter number</span>: 3</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Your current balance is $356.00</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Kay :</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">1</span>: Deposit</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">2</span>: Withdrawal</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">3</span>: Check Balance</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">4</span>: Quit</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Enter number</span>: 2</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Amount</span>: 600</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Insufficient funds to complete the transaction</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Amount</span>: 300</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Your new balance is $56.00</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Kay :</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">1</span>: Deposit</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">2</span>: Withdrawal</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">3</span>: Check Balance</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">4</span>: Quit</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Enter number</span>: 1</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Amount</span>: 100</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Your new balance is $156.00</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Kay </span>:    </span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">1</span>: Deposit</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">2</span>: Withdrawal</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">3</span>: Check Balance</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">4</span>: Quit</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Enter number</span>: 4</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Goodbye</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>In this exercise, we will be working with inheritance, and thinking about how we can set up our inheritance hierarchy to make our lives easier. There is an easy way and a difficult way to complete this exercise. If you plan appropriately, you’ll find you won’t have to write very much code at all.</p><h4 id="Shapes"><a href="#Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Shapes"></a>Shapes</h4><p>Consider the following 4 shapes:</p><h4 id="Parallelogram"><a href="#Parallelogram" class="headerlink" title="Parallelogram"></a>Parallelogram</h4><p>A four sided figure with parallel pairs of sides. A Parallelogram is defined by the lengths of its two pairs of sides (labelled base and side in the picture below) and the interior angle (in degrees) between adjacent sides (labelled theta in the picture below).</p><h4 id="Rectangle"><a href="#Rectangle" class="headerlink" title="Rectangle"></a>Rectangle</h4><p>A parallelogram with four right angles. A Rectangle is defined by the lengths of its two pairs of sides (labelled base and side in the picture below).</p><h4 id="Rhombus"><a href="#Rhombus" class="headerlink" title="Rhombus"></a>Rhombus</h4><p>A parallelogram with four equal sides. A Rhombus is defined by the length of its sides (labelled base in the picture below) and the interior angle (in degrees) between adjacent sides (labelled theta in the picture below).</p><h4 id="Square"><a href="#Square" class="headerlink" title="Square"></a>Square</h4><p>A parallelogram with four equal sides and four right angles; both a Rectangle and a Rhombus. A Square is defined by the length of its sides (labelled base in the picture below).</p><p>Your first task is to figure out the IS-A hierarchy of these shapes. Draw it out in a piece of paper. Are there any instances of multiple parents?</p><h3 id="Your-Task"><a href="#Your-Task" class="headerlink" title="Your Task"></a>Your Task</h3><p>You must write four classes: Parallelogram, Rectangle, Rhombus and Square, ensuring that the class hierarchy follows your diagram from the previous step. You may create additional classes if you wish (are there any good reasons why you might want to do this?). The parameters of init methods should always be input in the following order: (base, side, theta) (theta being given in degrees), though of course, not every class’ init will take all three. So for example, a Rectangle will only take (base, side).</p><p>Objects of these classes must have the following methods:</p><ul><li>area() - returns the area of the shape<br>Note: The area of a parallelogram is computed by base side sin(theta)<br>Warning: function math.sin in Python expects its argument to be an angle given in radians - take a look at the function math.radians to convert between degrees and radians.</li><li>bst() - returns a list of three floats: [base, side, theta]. Even if a shape doesn’t need one of the parameters for its input, it should still be able to return it. (e.g., a 10 x 10 square would return: [10.0, 10.0, 90.0]).</li><li>When printed, each shape should return a string with text in the following format “I am a shape with area area”. Four example, a 10 x 10 square would return the string: “I am a Square with area 100”.</li></ul><h3 id="Be-Lazy"><a href="#Be-Lazy" class="headerlink" title="Be Lazy"></a>Be Lazy</h3><p>One way to solve this would be to write four completely independent classes, and have each class completely implement all of their own functions. This would be a bad idea (why?). If you use inheritance correctly, you should find the exercise much simpler. Remember, you should never calculate something when you can just get another method to do the work for you. Hint: It’s possible to set more than one parent for your class. Are there any shapes here for which that would be a sensible thing to do?</p><h3 id="What-to-Submit"><a href="#What-to-Submit" class="headerlink" title="What to Submit"></a>What to Submit</h3><p>All of your code should be submitted to MarkUs in a file called ex9.py that doesn’t import anything other than math, and does not ask for input or print anything when imported.</p>]]></content>

This will be a very basic waveform concatenation system, whereby the acoustic units are recordings of monophones. You will be provided with several files that you must use to do this:</p><h4 id="SimpleAudio-py"><a href="#SimpleAudio-py" class="headerlink" title="SimpleAudio.py"></a>SimpleAudio.py</h4><p>This is a version of the SimpleAudio.py module that we have used in the lab sessions. The Audio class will allow you to save, load and play .wav files as well as perform some simple audio processing functions. You should not modify this file.</p><h4 id="synth-py"><a href="#synth-py" class="headerlink" title="synth.py"></a>synth.py</h4><p>This is a skeleton structure of the program. Your task is to fill in the missing components to make it work.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Core-Description"><a href="#Core-Description" class="headerlink" title="Core Description"></a>Core Description</h3><p>For the core, you will implement a program that creates a model of a music artist’s lyrics. This model receives lyric data as input and ultimately generates new lyrics in the style of that artist. To do this, you will leverage an NLP concept called an n-gram and use an NLP technique called language modeling.<br>Your understanding of the linked concepts and definitions is crucial to your success, so make sure to understand n-grams, language modeling, Python dictionaries as taught in the warmup, and classes and inheritance in Python before attempting to implement the core.<br>The core does not require you to include any external libraries beyond what has already been included for you. Use of any other external libraries is prohibited on this part of the project.</p><h3 id="Core-Structure"><a href="#Core-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Core Structure"></a>Core Structure</h3><p>In the language-models/folder, you will find four files which contain class definitions: nGramModel.py, unigramModel.py, bigramModel.py, and trigramModel.py. You must complete the prepData, weightedChoice, and getNextToken functions in nGramModel.py. You must also complete the trainModel, trainingDataHasNGram, and getCandidateDictionary functions in each of the other three files.<br>In the root CreativeAI repository, there is a file called generate.py, which will be the driver for generating both lyrics and music. For the core, you will implement the trainLyricsModels, selectNGramModel, generateSentence, and runLyricsGenerator functions; these functions will be called, directly or indirectly, by main, which is written for you.<br>We recommend that you implement the functions in the order they are listed in the spec; start with prepData and work your way down to runLyricsGenerator.</p><h3 id="Getting-New-Lyrics-Optional"><a href="#Getting-New-Lyrics-Optional" class="headerlink" title="Getting New Lyrics (Optional)"></a>Getting New Lyrics (Optional)</h3><p>If your group chooses to use lyrics from an artist other than the Beatles, you can use the web scraper we have written to get the lyrics of the new artist and save them in the data/lyrics directory for you. A web scraper is a program that gets information from web pages: ours, which lives in the data/scrapers directory.<br>If you navigate to the data/scrapers folder and run the lyricsWikiaScraper.py file, you will be prompted to input the name of an artist. If that artist is found on lyrics.wikia.com, the program will make a folder in the data/lyrics directory for that artist, and save each of the artist’s songs as a .txt file in that folder.</p><h3 id="Explanation-of-Functions-to-Implement"><a href="#Explanation-of-Functions-to-Implement" class="headerlink" title="Explanation of Functions to Implement"></a>Explanation of Functions to Implement</h3><h4 id="prepData"><a href="#prepData" class="headerlink" title="prepData"></a>prepData</h4><p>The purpose of this function is to take input data in the form of a list of lists, and return a copy of that list with symbols added to both ends of each inner list.<br>For the core, these inner lists will be sentences, which are represented as lists of strings. The symbols added to the beginning of each sentence will be ^::^ followed by ^:::^, and the symbol added to the end of each sentence will be $:::$. These are arbitrary symbols, but make sure to use them exactly and in the correct order.<br>For example, if the function is passed this list of lists:<br><figure class="highlight scheme"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[ [<span class="symbol">'hey</span>', <span class="symbol">'jude</span>'], [<span class="symbol">'yellow</span>', <span class="symbol">'submarine</span>'] ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Then it would return a new list that looks like this:<br><figure class="highlight scheme"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[ [<span class="symbol">'^::^</span>', <span class="symbol">'^:::^</span>', <span class="symbol">'hey</span>', <span class="symbol">'jude</span>', <span class="symbol">'$:::$</span>'], [<span class="symbol">'^::^</span>', <span class="symbol">'^:::^</span>', <span class="symbol">'yellow</span>', <span class="symbol">'submarine</span>', <span class="symbol">'$:::$</span>'] ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The purpose of adding two symbols at the beginning of each sentence is so that you can look at a trigram containing only the first English word of that sentence. This captures information about which words are most likely to begin a sentence; without these symbols, you would not be able to use the trigam model at the beginning of sentences because there would be no trigrams to look at until the third word.<br>The purpose of adding a symbol to the end of each sentence is to be able to generate sentence endings. If you ever see $:::$ while generating a sentence in the generateSentence function, you know the sentence is complete.</p><h4 id="trainModel"><a href="#trainModel" class="headerlink" title="trainModel"></a>trainModel</h4><p>This function trains the NGramModel child classes on the input data by building their dictionary of n-grams and respective counts, self.nGramCounts. Note that the special starting and ending symbols also count as words for all NGramModels, which is why you should use the return value of prepData before you create the self.nGramCounts dictionary for each language model.</p><ul><li>For the unigram model, self.nGramCounts will be a one-dimensional dictionary of {unigram: unigramCount} pairs, where each unique unigram is somewhere in the input data, and unigramCount is the number of times the model saw that particular unigram appear in the data. The unigram model should not consider the special symbols ‘^::^’ and ‘^:::^’ as words, but it should consider the ending symbol $:::$ as a word. The bigram and trigram modles should consider all special symbols as words.</li><li>For the bigram model, the dictionary will be two-dimensional. It will be structured as {unigramOne: {unigramTwo: bigramCount}}, where bigramCount is the count of how many times this model has seen unigramOne + unigramTwo appear as a bigram in the input data. For example, if the only song you were looking at was Strawberry Fields Forever, part of the BigramModel’s self.nGramCounts dictionary would look like this.</li><li>For the trigram model, the dictionary will be three-dimensional. It will be structured as {unigramOne: {unigramTwo: {unigramThree: trigramCount}}}, where trigramCount is the count of how many times this model has seen unigramOne + unigramTwo + unigramThree appear as a trigram in the input data.</li></ul><h4 id="getCandidateDictionary"><a href="#getCandidateDictionary" class="headerlink" title="getCandidateDictionary"></a>getCandidateDictionary</h4><p>This function returns a dictionary of candidate next words to be added to the current sentence. More specifically, it returns the set of words that are legal to follow the sentence passed in, given the particular language model’s training data. So it looks at the sentence, figures out what word the model thinks can follow the last words in the sentence, and returns that set of words and counts. Note: when you write this function, you may assume that that the trainingDataHasNGram function for this specific language model instance has returned True.</p><p>For each n-gram model, this function will look at the last n - 1 words in the current sentence, index into self.nGramCounts using those words, and return a dictionary of possible n-th words and their counts. For example, the unigram model is an n-gram model for which n = 1, so the unigram model looks at the previous 0 words in the sentence. Therefore, the unigram model sees every word in its training data as a candidate; in other words, the unigram model version of getCandidateDictionary should return its entire self.nGramCounts dictionary. Based on this knowledge, what dictionaries should the bigram and trigram models return?<br>Hint: the indexing method you use here will be syntactically very similar to what you did in trainingDataHasNGram.</p><h4 id="printSongLyrics"><a href="#printSongLyrics" class="headerlink" title="printSongLyrics"></a>printSongLyrics</h4><p>This function takes three parameters which are lists of lists of strings: verseOne, verseTwo, and chorus. It then prints out the song in this order: verse one, chorus, verse two, chorus.</p><h4 id="getUserInput"><a href="#getUserInput" class="headerlink" title="getUserInput"></a>getUserInput</h4><p>This function takes three parameters: teamName, which should be the name of your group; lyricsSource, which should be the name of the artist that you’re generating lyrics for; and musicSource, which should be the name of the source from which you got your music data for the reach.<br>The function returns a user’s choice between 1 and 3, looping while the user does not input a valid choice. Choice 1 is for generating lyrics; choice 2 is for generating music; and choice 3 is to quit the program.</p><h4 id="main"><a href="#main" class="headerlink" title="main"></a>main</h4><p>This function first trains instances of language models on the lyrics and music data by calling the trainLyricsModels and trainMusicModels functions. Then, it calls getUserInput and uses the return value of that function to either generate new lyrics by calling runLyricsGenerator, or generate a song by calling runMusicGenerator. Note that the trainMusicModels and runMusicGenerator functions don’t need to be touched for the core.<br>At the beginning of main there are several string variables to hold your group’s name, the name of the artist you’re using, etc. Make sure to update these values with your team’s name and your choices of data.</p><h3 id="Tips-for-Speeding-Up-Your-Program"><a href="#Tips-for-Speeding-Up-Your-Program" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Speeding Up Your Program"></a>Tips for Speeding Up Your Program</h3><p>If your program is taking a long time to load the data and train the models, it’s likely that inefficiencies in your code are slowing down your program. The most common cause of inefficiency is too many nested loops in your trainModel functions. For example, if you have 10 words, and you run through the words once for each word in the list (i.e. 10 times), that will be 100 steps total, which is not too bad. But if you have 10,000 words in the dataset, and you look at each one 10,000 times, then that will be 100,000,000, which is bad.<br>Each version of the trainModel function can be written correctly with at most two levels of nested for loops, and a typical program should not take more than around 30 seconds to load. Try experimenting with different loop structures if your program is taking too long to load.</p><h3 id="How-to-Run-Your-Program-to-Generate-Lyrics"><a href="#How-to-Run-Your-Program-to-Generate-Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="How to Run Your Program to Generate Lyrics"></a>How to Run Your Program to Generate Lyrics</h3><p>If you are using PyCharm, open generate.py and click “Run…” in the top navigation bar. If you are working from the command line, navigate to the root directory where your CreativeAI project is stored and type:<br>python generate.py</p><p>Even if you have not implemented any of the functions in the project, the starter code should work out of the box. Therefore, you can play around with it and get a feel for how the driver in main works.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Problem-Description"><a href="#Problem-Description" class="headerlink" title="Problem Description"></a>Problem Description</h3><p>In this problem, you should implement the lexical analysis task for a limited version (i.e., the depth of the nested loops) of a programming language. Lexical analysis is the first stage that compilers parse and detect the possible syntax errors.</p><p>Ideally, any new (programming) languages can be designed and analyzed in the similar manner. You will need to analyze a Pascal-and-C-like language in this programming assignment.</p><p>Given a segment of the source code, your C++ code should analyze the code and extract all tokens, which include:</p><ul><li>Keywords: keywords are the words reserved by the language. They are all uppercase. In the case of this simplified language, the keywords are restricted to the set { “BEGIN”, “END”, “FOR” }</li><li>Identifiers: An identifier is used to describe the variables, which are all lower-case</li><li>Constants: Numbers like 10, … .</li><li>Operators: all arithmetic operations (i.e., +, -, *, and /), “++” and “=”</li><li>Delimiters: like “,” and “;”</li></ul><p>Your C++ code should input a text file from user, which contains the expression he/she wants the compilers to analyze. Then, your code should parse the input, detect the tokens, classify them, and print out the results.</p><p>With this assignment, you will get practice with the stack implementation which is one of the most widely used data structures. Besides, you will be familiar with string processing and input parsing, which are of crucial importance in most C++ projects.</p><h3 id="Details"><a href="#Details" class="headerlink" title="Details"></a>Details</h3><p>(Data Structures) You need to implement a stack data structure to keep track of the processing and compute the depth of the nested loops. Adding elements to the stack (push) and removing objects from it (pop) are two essential methods that must be implemented. You can use any data structure to implement the stack, e.g., arrays, linked-lists, etc.</p><p>(Algorithms) Once the input expression is given, your program should decide which character should be inserted to the stack, and when the result needs to be computed. You need to detect the possible syntax errors while tracing the depth of the nested loops.</p><h3 id="Example-Run"><a href="#Example-Run" class="headerlink" title="Example Run"></a>Example Run</h3><p>Try to keep your output as close to the given format as possible:<br>In this example, the input file is “code.txt”<br>It contains the code segment below:</p><figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">FOR (i, 10, ++)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">BEGIN</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">FOR</span> (j, <span class="number">10</span>, ++)</span><br><span class="line">  BEGAN</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">sum</span>=<span class="keyword">sum</span> + i + j;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">END</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">END</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><figure class="highlight vhdl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; ./pa3.<span class="keyword">out</span></span><br><span class="line">INPUT&gt; Please enter the name <span class="keyword">of</span> the input <span class="keyword">file</span>:</span><br><span class="line">code.txt</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">OUTPUT&gt; The depth <span class="keyword">of</span> nested <span class="keyword">loop</span>(s) <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">Keywords: <span class="keyword">FOR</span> <span class="keyword">BEGIN</span> <span class="keyword">END</span></span><br><span class="line">Identifier: sum i j</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Constant</span>: <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line">Operatros: ++ = +</span><br><span class="line">Delimiter: ; ,</span><br><span class="line">Syntax <span class="literal">Error</span>(s): BEGAN</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Hints"><a href="#Hints" class="headerlink" title="Hints"></a>Hints</h3><p>You should get your stack data structure working well before implementing the lexical analysis task.</p><p>The string processing to parse the input is an essential part of this assignment. You should make sure that you parse the input correctly, and you take care of all edge cases, e.g., more than one spaces between characters, no spaces, etc.</p><h3 id="Grading-Criteria"><a href="#Grading-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Grading Criteria"></a>Grading Criteria</h3><ol><li><p>Successful Compilation: Your source code should be able to compile using g++ -Wall command without any error or warning. The output should be a valid executable. Please note that we will be using g++ compiler on Linux to grade your programs. If you are using other compilers or IDE (e.g., Visual C++), it is recommended that you test the source codes with g++ before the CANVAS submission (i.e., make sure there is no warning).</p></li><li><p>Program Correctness: The executable should be able to run correctly by giving<br>out the required output.</p></li><li><p>Programming Style: Good coding style is a key to efficient programming. We<br>encourage you to write clear and readable codes. You should adopt a sensible set of coding conventions, including proper indentation, necessary comments and more. Here are some guidelines of good programming style.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Final-Notes"><a href="#Final-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Final Notes"></a>Final Notes</h3><p>Again, remember to start the programming assignments as soon as possible. Unlike the conventional assignments, programming assignments sometimes take un-predictable amount of time to finish. Thus, have the code running first, then polish it later with the extra time before the deadline.</p>]]></content>

User can enter the options of the corresponding actions.<br><figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Welcome Message designed by your group</span><br><span class="line">***<span class="built_in"> System </span>Menu ***</span><br><span class="line">[1] Start Drawing</span><br><span class="line">[2] Change Board Size</span><br><span class="line">[3] Instructions</span><br><span class="line">[4] Credits</span><br><span class="line">[5] Exit</span><br><span class="line">*******************</span><br><span class="line">Option (1 - 5):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><h3 id="Start-Drawing"><a href="#Start-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="Start Drawing"></a>Start Drawing</h3><p>When the user inputs 1 in the System Menu, an empty drawing board is displayed with a pen in the middle. Then the user controls the pen in the drawing board by inputting commands, until a “QUIT” command is entered.</p><h4 id="Drawing-Board"><a href="#Drawing-Board" class="headerlink" title="Drawing Board"></a>Drawing Board</h4><p>The drawing board consists of a square drawing area with a default size 30 x 30. The area is enclosed by a boundary with characters ‘|’ for vertical boundary, ‘-‘ for horizontal boundary, and ‘+’ for the corner.</p><h4 id="Pen"><a href="#Pen" class="headerlink" title="Pen"></a>Pen</h4><p>The initial location of the pen is in the middle of the drawing area. Then based on the user control, the pen can move within the drawing area. An arrow character is displayed in the drawing area to indicate the current location of the pen.</p><p>The pen is represented by different arrow characters according to the direction it is facing. There are 8 available directions, with 45 o each (default is 0, i.e. upward). The corresponding ASCII code in decimal of each arrow is given.</p><h4 id="User-Control"><a href="#User-Control" class="headerlink" title="User Control"></a>User Control</h4><p>User can input one or multiple commands at a time to control the action of the pen. You may assume that user always input less than 200 characters each time.</p><p>If multiple commands are input, they must be separated by at least one space. The commands are case-insensitive.</p><p>The commands are executed one by one in the sequence of user input. When all commands have been executed, the drawing board is refreshed to show the most updated drawings. Then the user can input another set of commands again.</p><p>Appropriate error checking on user input of commands is expected. Whenever an error occurs, an error message should be displayed. All remaining commands will be ignored. The drawing board is then refreshed to show the most updated status.</p><p>For example, an erroneous input may look like:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">FD <span class="number">10</span> RT <span class="number">90</span> BK LT <span class="number">45</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Only “FD 10” and “RT 90” are executed because the argument for command “BK” is missing. The last command “LT 45” is ignored and not executed.</p><h4 id="Quit"><a href="#Quit" class="headerlink" title="Quit"></a>Quit</h4><p>When the user inputs the command “QUIT”, the system prompts for user’s confirmation. If the user inputs ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the system returns back to the System Menu. If the user inputs ‘n’ or ‘N’, the system remains at the drawing board. Other input is not acceptable and the system should ask the user to confirm again.</p><h3 id="Change-Board-Size"><a href="#Change-Board-Size" class="headerlink" title="Change Board Size"></a>Change Board Size</h3><p>When the user inputs 2 in the System Menu, the system displays the current size (length of a side, default is 30). Then the user is allowed to input the new size within the range of 20 to 50, inclusively. After the input, the system returns back to the System Menu.</p><h3 id="Instructions"><a href="#Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Instructions"></a>Instructions</h3><p>The system displays the instructions for using the console drawing board. After displaying the instruction, the system returns back to the System Menu.</p><h3 id="Credits"><a href="#Credits" class="headerlink" title="Credits"></a>Credits</h3><p>The system displays the personal particulars (e.g. student name, student ID, class, tutorial group, etc.) of the group members. After displaying the information, the system returns back to the System Menu.</p><h3 id="Exit"><a href="#Exit" class="headerlink" title="Exit"></a>Exit</h3><p>When the user inputs this option, the system prompts for user’s confirmation. If the user inputs ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the program terminates. If the user inputs ‘n’ or ‘N’, the system returns to the System Menu. Other input is not acceptable and the system should ask the user to confirm again.</p><h3 id="Other-General-Requirements"><a href="#Other-General-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Other General Requirements"></a>Other General Requirements</h3><p>Meaningful guidelines should be printed to assist with user’s input. Whenever an option is selected, meaningful messages should be displayed.</p><p>Suitable checking on user’s input is expected. Appropriate error messages should be printed whenever unexpected situation happens, e.g., invalid input, input out-of-range, etc.</p><p>The use of functions (in addition to main function) and classes are expected in your program. Appropriate comments should be added in your source code file.</p><p>Creativity and Critical Thinking: other features that you find useful or can enhance the user experience can also be implemented.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Description"><a href="#Description" class="headerlink" title="Description"></a>Description</h3><p>The purpose of this assignment is to build an application that</p><ol><li>Locates a .quiz file on your hard drive and opens it</li><li>Reads each of the objects in that file into an array (for easier handling)</li><li>Each object contains a question and an array of possible answers, along with the correct answer, the difficulty level, the number of points awarded, etc. Therefore, each pane will need to display this information into the pane</li><li>The code loops through the array of objects, and on each iteration displays a new Q/A combination. The program terminates when the questions are finished, and displays the number of correct responses out of the total number of questions asked.</li></ol><h3 id="QuizMaster"><a href="#QuizMaster" class="headerlink" title="QuizMaster"></a>QuizMaster</h3><h4 id="Load-the-code-for-this-lab-available-on-Blackboard-into-a-new-project"><a href="#Load-the-code-for-this-lab-available-on-Blackboard-into-a-new-project" class="headerlink" title="Load the code for this lab, available on Blackboard, into a new project"></a>Load the code for this lab, available on Blackboard, into a new project</h4><ul><li>In Eclipse, create a new project called Assignment1</li><li>Download Assignment1.zip from Blackboard and open the contents into a package</li></ul><h4 id="Review-the-files-in-Assignment1-zip-and-make-sure-you-understand-their-purpose"><a href="#Review-the-files-in-Assignment1-zip-and-make-sure-you-understand-their-purpose" class="headerlink" title="Review the files in Assignment1.zip and make sure you understand their purpose"></a>Review the files in Assignment1.zip and make sure you understand their purpose</h4><p>There are four files included with this assignment, which you must use, and which you must submit with your finished assignment.<br>QuizMain is the main point of entry for your program. It performs three main actions: it loads a simple splash pane (given); it opens the file containing the Q/A objects and loads them into an array, and then loops through the array loading each question into a BorderPane with separate sections for the question, answers, and explanation; and finally displays the results of the quiz.</p><p>Note that each of the three sections is associated with a method that loads up a different Pane object. getSplashPane() loads a simple text message (“Welcome to QuizMaster”) for initial display in the centre of a BorderPane. getCurrentQAPane() uses the current QA object to load up a BorderPane with some of the components of the QA object. getResultsPane() displays the results of the quiz. getSplashPane() is provided for you; more information on the other two panes is provided below.</p><p>FileUtils is a class containing static methods that perform basic file I/O operations, including checking to see if the file exists, returning the file name, and so on. The static method getFileHandle() calls up the FileChooser dialog box, shown below, which prompts the user to select a .quiz file (to be provided), which contains the QA objects to be loaded. Note that the other utilities in this class rely on a file having been correctly selected. If the ‘Cancel’ button on the dialog is selected, then no file handle is returned from getFileHandle(), and any further attempts to return a path name to the file return an empty string.</p><p>If they do wish to continue, then prompt them with the above dialog again, otherwise execute Platform.exit() to exit the program.</p><p>The code in FileUtils is mostly complete, with the exception of the getQAArray() method, which you’ll need to supply. This method reads in the absolute path of the file returned from getFileHandle() - you can use getFileName() to return this string, assuming it was correctly supplied by the user—and loads each object into an array of QA objects, which gets returned to the user.</p><p>QuesAns is an abstract class that lists the abstract methods required elsewhere in your program.</p><p>QA extends QuesAns and supplies concrete methods. Use the QA class when you need to load the QA objects from the .ques file returned by getFileHandle(), as indicated above in part (b), and when you need to load the currentQAPane, as indicated below</p><h4 id="Supply-the-classes-methods-required-to-allow-for-the-correct-execution-of-your-program"><a href="#Supply-the-classes-methods-required-to-allow-for-the-correct-execution-of-your-program" class="headerlink" title="Supply the classes/methods required to allow for the correct execution of your program"></a>Supply the classes/methods required to allow for the correct execution of your program</h4><p>Note that the method FileUtils.showAndWait(FileUtils.ON) effectively pauses the program to give the user time to input a response. Without such a mechanism, the enhanced for loop that drives the program would simply loop through and load every pane in rapid succession, with no way to allow the user time to read questions and select answers.</p><p>There are better ways to perform this operation, but they involve code that is beyond our reach just now. For now, showAndWait() does the job. Therefore, when the user wishes to move on to the next question, the NEXT QUESTION button must execute FileUtils.showAndWait(FileUtiles.OFF), to allow the program to load the next QA object in the loop.</p><p>Also note that, for demonstration purposes, the .ques file will only contain MAX_QA_SIZE questions (initially set to 5); hence we only load MAX_QA_SIZE objects into the array, and loop through the enhanced for loop MAX_QA_SIZE times. This will change in Assignment 2 when we modify this code to accommodate files of any size.</p><p>Aside from the getQAArray code needed to complete the FileUtils class, along with the code needed to display the results at the end of the program, most of your time will be spent writing the code needed to display the current Question/Answers combination.</p><p>The getCurrentPane() method, which reads in the currentQA object, should be included in QuizMain, along with the two other ‘getPane()’ methods needed for proper execution of the program.</p><p>Your QA input pane should look something like the screenshot shown in the figure below.</p><p>Note however that you have considerably flexibility in how you choose to present this information, including which type of pane(s) you use, which fonts, etc. There are some things which you must do however:</p><ul><li>The output should be positioned in the middle of the window</li><li>The text output should maintain its general features when resized (e.g. to full screen)</li><li>When the Check Answer button is selected, it should indicate in the space below the answers (a) which answer is correct, displaying the currentQA.explanation() String into the bottom of the screen to explain why the answer was correct or incorrect (not shown above).</li><li>In the Next Question event handler, set FileUtils.waitAndShow(OFF). This should allow your program to move on to the next QA object, thereby loading the next question into the pane.</li><li>You must use Radio Buttons for the Answers section of the pane, and this will require that you construct a new class, called AnswerPane, described next.<br>The AnswerPane class stores all the information needed to load and display the answers, as well as record which one of the radio buttons was selected. The UML diagram for AnswerPane is shown below.</li></ul><p>The getButtonSelected() method should loop through the array of radio buttons and use the radio button’s isSelected() property to determine which button was chosen by the user.</p><p>The Check Answer button is not part of the AnswerPane, however it relies on an instance of the AnswerPane object to (1) get the answer selected by the user using getButtonSeleted() (2) compare this with the correct answer, as provided by the QA object (3) store the result in the QA object using the setResult() method, true if the answer was correct and false otherwise (4) Load the response string beneath the answers so the user can check the results.</p><p>The resultsPane() loops through each QA object reports constructs a text string for display in the pane returned by this method. The text should indicate (1) the question number (2) whether the answer with CORRECT or WRONG, and (3) at the very end, the total score, based on the total number of correct answers divided by the total number of questions.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Practical-Work"><a href="#Practical-Work" class="headerlink" title="Practical Work"></a>Practical Work</h3><p>By using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, develop an object-oriented console application that can handle emails. Your program is NOT expected to be able to send emails. It is for providing the environment to build a database of the emails, displaying and handling the database content. While you are responsible for the final design of the console application, your program is expected to realise a class cEmail representing an email that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Member variables including the fields To_From (that contains a name followed by an email address put inside a pair of square brackets, and a character to indicate whether it is a sent-to-receiver or received-from-sender message), Subject, Cc (that contains a name followed by an email address put inside a pair of square brackets), Message, and Date (e.g. 8 November 2015 can be represented by the integer 151108). Notice that the first 4 member variables are for storing a string, while the member variable Date is of type int.</li><li>Member functions for reading and writing the member variables in cEmail.</li></ul><p>Then, develop the class Em_Han to build up a database that keeps the emails ever sent or received. The database can be realised by an array of a finite size, which is assumed big enough and your program does not need to check this. Member functions that allow the user to build up and display the content of the database should be implemented. Then, within the class, you are required to write public member function(s) to realise one of the following five tasks (of handling the email messages). The task to do should be determined by the remainder obtained from dividing your team number by 5. For example, if your team number is SEVEN, 7%5 = 2, you should do Task 2) of this assignment.</p><h3 id="Task"><a href="#Task" class="headerlink" title="Task"></a>Task</h3><ol><li><p>The function performs the sorting of the received emails based on the name of the sender (within the To_From field) in ascending order, and display a sorted list of sender name, subject and date of sending.<br>Hint: To do the sorting, notice that strcmp(“Peter”, “Mary”) will return 1, meaning that “Peter” is larger than “Mary”. Similarly, strcmp(“Mary”, “Peter”) will return -1, strcmp(“Mary”,”Mary”) will return 0. Notice that you can ignore the sent-to-receiver messages.</p></li><li><p>The function performs the sorting of the sent emails based on the name of the receiver (within the To_From field) in ascending order, and display a sorted list of receiver name, subject and date of receiving. To do the sorting, read the hint in Task 0). Notice that you can ignore the received-from-sender messages.</p></li><li><p>The function performs the sorting of the emails based on the date in ascending order, and display a sorted list of date, name, and subject together with a string indicating it is a sent or received message.</p></li><li><p>The function performs the sorting of the emails based on the subject in ascending order, and display the sorted list of subject, name, and date together with a string indicating it is a sent or received message. To do the sorting, read the hint in Task 0).</p></li><li><p>The function asks the user to input a name, and display a numbered list of subject and date of the email together with a string indicating it is a sent or received email under that name. The user can then enter a number and the corresponding email will be deleted from the database.</p></li></ol><p>Hint: You can add a member variable in the cEmail class that specifies whether it is a valid email. If an email is deleted from the database, that email becomes an invalid email. On displaying the content of the database, only valid emails will be shown.</p><ul><li>It is required that the class and the implementation of its member functions should be built as a separate static library and linked into the console application.</li><li>Your program is expected to provide a text-mode user interface so that users can repeatedly handle and display the database of emails until the user chooses to end the application.</li><li>Should you want to get a credit, you should design the application such that when a user wants to start it, he needs to login the application with a username first, which will be checked with a file that stores username-password pairs. If the username is new, the application will ask for a password from the user and store it into that file. If the username can be found in that file, the application will start only when the password is correct. The application will end if the user fails to provide the correct password in three consecutive trials.</li></ul><h3 id="General-Description"><a href="#General-Description" class="headerlink" title="General Description"></a>General Description</h3><ol><li><p>Each team should comprise up to TWO students (THREE students for HD class).</p></li><li><p>Unless you get prior approval from your subject lecturer/tutor, you must observe the following:</p></li><li><p>Do NOT use any technique or C++ constructs not taught in the subject</p><ul><li>Any library not mentioned in the subject must NOT be used (e.g. the mathematics library to compute x to the power of y.)</li><li>Each team should upload the zipped file to the Blackboard (under Groups, select File Exchange after clicking your team number).</li></ul></li><li><p>The documentation for your assignment is important. The ability of writing good comments in the program will also be an important factor to the final assessment of your assignment.</p></li><li><p>It is compulsory to use a word processing tool to write your report. The font size must not be bigger than 12 or smaller than 10. Use 1.5 lines spacing on both sides of a page. Including all figures and tables, if any, the length of the report should not be shorter than 7 pages.</p></li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>This assignment will give you practice with recursion, regular expressions, and grammars and will give you another opportunity to work with maps. You will complete a program that reads an input file with a grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) and will allow the user to randomly generate elements of the grammar.</p><p>You will be given a main program that does the file processing and user interaction. It is called GrammarMain.java. You are to write a class called GrammarSolver that manipulates the grammar. A grammar will be specified as a sequence of Strings, each of which represents the rules for a nonterminal symbol. Each String will be of the form:<br><figure class="highlight bnf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">&lt;nonterminal symbol&gt;</span>::=&lt;rule&gt;|&lt;rule&gt;|&lt;rule&gt;|…|&lt;rule&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Notice that this is the standard BNF format of a nonterminal symbol on the left-hand-side and a series of rules separated by vertical bar characters (“|”) on the right-hand side. If there is only one rule for a particular nonterminal, then there will be no vertical bar characters. BNF productions use the characters “::=” to separate the symbol from the rules.</p><p>There will be exactly one occurrence of “::=” per String. The text appearing before the “::=” is a nonterminal symbol. You may assume that it is not empty, that it does not contain a vertical bar character, and that it does not contain any whitespace. Often we surround nonterminal symbols with the characters, but this will not always be the case. The text appearing after the “::=” will be a nonempty series of rules separated by vertical bar characters (“|”). Each of these rules will have a series of tokens (always at least one) separated and potentially surrounded by whitespace. There could be any amount of whitespace surrounding tokens. Any token that appears to the left of a “::=” in the grammar is considered a nonterminal. All other tokens are considered terminals.</p><p>The grammars you will be asked to process will be stored in text files with each line of the file being of the form described above. GrammarMain reads this file into a List and passes the list to the constructor of your GrammarSolver. Your solver has to be able to perform certain tasks, most notably generating random elements of the grammar.</p><p>To generate a random instantiation of a nonterminal, you simply pick at random one of its rules and generate whatever that rule tells you to generate. Notice that this is a recursive process. Generating a nonterminal involves picking one of its rules at random and then generating each part of that rule, which might involve more nonterminal symbols to generate for which you pick rules at random and generate each part of those rules, and so on. Depending upon the grammar, this process could continue indefinitely. Any grammar you will be asked to work with will be guaranteed to converge in a finite period of time. Most often this process doesn’t go on indefinitely because many rules involve terminals rather than nonterminals. . When you encounter a terminal, you simply include it in the String you are generating. This becomes the base case of the recursive process. Your generating method produces various String objects. Each String should be compact in the sense that there should be exactly one space between each terminal and there should be no leading or trailing spaces.</p><p>For example, the grammar on the previous page could be used to randomly generate a non-terminal for the sentence, “Fred honored the green wonderful child”, as shown in the diagram on the next page:</p><p>Your class must include the following public methods.<br>|  Method   |     Description  |<br>|  ———–  | ———–  |<br>| GrammarSolver(List grammar)  | This method will be passed a grammar as a List of Strings. Your method should store this in a convenient way so that you can later generate parts of the grammar. It should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the grammar is empty or if there are two or more entries in the grammar for the same nonterminal. Your method is not to change the List of Strings. |<br>| boolean grammarContains(String symbol)  | Returns true if the given symbol is a nonterminal of the grammar; returns false otherwise. |<br>| String[] generate(String symbol, int times)  | In this method you should use the grammar to randomly generate the given number of occurrences of the given symbol and you should return the result as an array of Strings. For any given nonterminal symbol, each of its rules should be applied with equal probability. It should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the grammar does not contain the given nonterminal symbol or if the number of times is less than 0. |<br>| String getSymbols()  | This method should return a String representation of the various nonterminal symbols from the grammar as a sorted, comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, as in “[, , ]” |</p><p>Case matters when comparing symbols. For example, S would not be considered the same as.</p><p>The directory crawler program will serve as a good guide for how to write this program. In that program, the recursive method has a for-each loop. This is perfectly acceptable. Just because we are now learning how to use recursion, we don’t want to abandon what we know about loops. If you find that some part of this problem is easily solved with a loop, then go ahead and use one. In the directory crawler, the hard part was writing code to traverse all of the different directories and that’s where we used recursion. For your program the hard part is following the grammar to generate different parts of the grammar, so that is the place to use recursion.</p><p>You will discover that when writing recursive solutions to problems, we often find ourselves with a public/private pair of methods. You will want to use that approach here. You have been asked to write a public method called generate that will generate an array of Strings. But internally inside your object, you’re going to want to produce these values one String at a time using a recursive method. You should make this internal method private so that it is not visible to the client.</p><p>We want you to store the grammar in a particular way. We are making use of the SortedMap interface and the implementation TreeMap, both in java.util. Maps keep track of key/value pairs. Each key is associated with a particular value. In our case, we want to store something for each nonterminal symbol. So the nonterminal symbols become the keys and the rules become the values. Using this approach, you will find that the getSymbols method can be written quickly because the SortedMap interface includes a method called keySet that returns a set of keys from the map. If you ask for the “toString” of this set, you will get the desired string. It is important to use the SortedMap/TreeMap combination because it keeps the keys in sorted order (notice that getSymbols requires that the nonterminals be listed in sorted order).</p><p>Below are some specific notes about Java constructs you should be using:</p><ul><li><p>The Random class in java.util can be used to generate a random integer by calling its nextInt method or you can use the method Math.random.</p></li><li><p>The String class has a method called “trim” that will return a new version of the String minus any leading or trailing whitespace.</p></li><li><p>One problem you will have to deal with is breaking up strings into various parts. You should use the split method of the String class to do so, although you are also allowed to use a string-based Scanner if you prefer. The split method makes use of what are called “regular expressions” and this can be confusing, but you will find that learning about regular expressions is extremely helpful for computer scientists and computer programmers. Many unix tools, for example, take regular expressions as input.</p></li></ul><p>In terms of correctness, your class must provide all of the functionality described above. In terms of style, we will be grading on your use of comments, good variable names, consistent indentation and good coding style to implement these operations. Remember that you will lose points if you declare variables as data fields that can instead be declared as local variables. You should also avoid extraneous cases (e.g., don’t make something into a special case if it doesn’t have to be). And you should continue to declare variables, fields, parameters and return types using an interface when possible.</p><p>You should name your file GrammarSolver.java and you should turn it in electronically from the “assignments” link on the class web page. A collection of files needed for the assignment is included on the web page as ass5.zip. You will need to have GrammarMain.java, sentence.txt and sentence2.txt in the same directory as your GrammarSolver.java in order to run GrammarMain. The second input file contains extraneous whitespace, including tabs. This second input file sometimes generates very long expressions as output.</p>]]></content>

The network is organized as a directed graph where each node represents an email address and the edge between two nodes (e.g., Address A and Address B) has a weight stating how many times A wrote to B. The boss is very interested in finding out the people most frequently contacted by others. Your task is to write a MapReduce program in Java to report the largest weight among all the weighted inbound edges for each node in the graph.</p><p>First, go over the Hadoop word count tutorial to get familiar with Hadoop and some Java basics. You will be able to complete this task with only some knowledge about Java. You should have already loaded two graph files into HDFS and loaded into your HDFS file system in your vm. Each file stores a list of edges as tab-separated-values. Each line represents a single edge consisting of three columns: (source node ID, target node ID, edge weight), each of which is separated by a tab (\t). Node IDs are positive integers, and weights are also positive integers. Edges are ordered randomly.</p><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">src  tgt  weight</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">117</span>  <span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">194</span>  <span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">299</span>  <span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">230</span>  <span class="number">151</span>  <span class="number">51</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">194</span>  <span class="number">151</span>  <span class="number">79</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">130</span>  <span class="number">10</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Your code should accept two arguments upon running. The first argument (​args[0]) will be a path for the input graph file on HDFS (e.g., /user/cse6242/graph1.tsv), and the second argument (​args[1]) will be a path for output directory on HDFS (e.g., /user/cse6242/task1output1). The default output mechanism of Hadoop will create multiple files on the output directory such as part-00000, part-00001, which will be merged and downloaded to a local directory by the supplied run script. Please use the run scripts for your convenience.</p><p>The format of the output should be such that each line represents a node ID and the largest weight among all its inbound edges. The ID and the largest weight must be separated by a tab (\t). Lines do not need be sorted. The following example result is computed based on the toy graph above. Please exclude nodes that do not have incoming edges (e.g., those email addresses that never get contacted by anybody).</p><p>For the toy graph above, the output is as follows.<br><figure class="highlight basic"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">51 </span>  <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">151 </span> <span class="number">79</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">130 </span> <span class="number">10</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Test your program on graph1.tsv and graph2.tsv. To demonstrate how your MapReduce procedure works, ​use the inline example above, trace the input and output of your map and reduce functions. That is, given the above graph as the input, describe the input and output of your map and reduce function(s) and how the functions transform/process the data (provide examples whenever appropriate). Write down your answers in ​description.pdf​. You are welcome to explain your answers using a combination of text and images.</p><h4 id="Designing-a-MapReduce-algorithm-and-thinking-in-MapReduce"><a href="#Designing-a-MapReduce-algorithm-and-thinking-in-MapReduce" class="headerlink" title="Designing a MapReduce algorithm (and thinking in MapReduce)"></a>Designing a MapReduce algorithm (and thinking in MapReduce)</h4><p>Design a MapReduce algorithm that accomplishes the following task: for each node i in a directed graph G, find that node’s in neighbors’ in neighbors​. Node u is considered to be an in neighbor of node v if there is a directed edge pointing from node u to node v. In other words, your task is find every “2-hop” neighbor of every node i in the graph G, where such a neighbor is connected by at least one directed path of length 2 that reaches node i.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: You only need to submit pseudo code, a brief explanation of your algorithm, and trace of input and output of your map and reduce functions for the graph given below. No coding is required​.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-2-Analyzing-a-Large-Graph-with-Spark-Scala"><a href="#Task-2-Analyzing-a-Large-Graph-with-Spark-Scala" class="headerlink" title="Task 2: Analyzing a Large Graph with Spark/Scala"></a>Task 2: Analyzing a Large Graph with Spark/Scala</h3><p>Please go over this ​Spark word count tutorial​ to get more background about Spark/Scala.</p><h4 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" class="headerlink" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h4><p>Your task is to calculate the gross accumulated node weights for each node in graph1.tsv and graph2.tsv from edge weights using Spark and Scala. Assume the graph to be a representation of a network flow where each edge represents the number of items flowing from source to target. The gross accumulated node weight for a node is now defined as the number of items produced/consumed by the node.</p><p>When loading the edges, parse the edge weights using the ​toInt method and filter out (ignore) all edges whose edge weights equal 1 i.e., only consider edges whose edge weights do not equal 1.</p><p>Your Scala program should handle the same two arguments as in Task 1 for input and output from the console, and should generate the same formatted output file on the supplied output directory (tab-separated-file). Please note that the default Spark saveastextfile method uses a saving format that is different from Hadoop’s, so you need to format the result before saving to file (Tip: use map and mkString). The result doesn’t need to be sorted.</p><h3 id="Task-3-Analyzing-Large-Amount-of-Data-with-Pig-on-AWS"><a href="#Task-3-Analyzing-Large-Amount-of-Data-with-Pig-on-AWS" class="headerlink" title="Task 3: Analyzing Large Amount of Data with Pig on AWS"></a>Task 3: Analyzing Large Amount of Data with Pig on AWS</h3><p>You will try out PIG (​<a href="http://pig.apache.org​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://pig.apache.org​</a>) for processing n-gram data on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is a fairly simple task, and in practice you may be able to tackle this using commodity computers (e.g., consumer-grade laptops or desktops). However, we would like you to use this exercise to learn and solve it using distributed computing on Amazon EC2, and gain experience (very helpful for your future career in research or industry), so you are prepared to tackle more complex problems.</p><p>The services you will primarily be using are Amazon S3 storage, Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) virtual servers in the cloud, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) managed Hadoop framework.</p><p>This task will ideally​ use up​ only a very small fraction of your $100 credit​. AWS allows you to use up to 20 instances in total (that means 1 master instance and up to 19 core instances) without filling out a “limit request form”. For this assignment, you should not exceed this quota of 20 instances​. You can learn about these instance types, their specs, and pricing at Instance Types​.</p><p>Please read the AWS Setup Guidelines provided to set up your AWS account. In this task, you will use subsets of the Google books n-grams dataset (full dataset for reference), on which you will perform some analysis. An ‘n -gram’ is a phrase with n words; the full n-gram dataset lists n-grams present in the books on books.google.com along with some statistics.</p><p>You will perform your analysis on two custom datasets, extracted from the Google books bigrams (2-grams), that we have prepared for you: a small one and a large one. To help you evaluate the correctness of your output, we have uploaded the output for the small dataset on T-Square (the link is here​ ).</p><blockquote><p>VERY IMPORTANT​ : Both these datasets are in the US-Standard (US-East) region. Using machines in other regions for computation would incur data transfer charges. Hence, set your region to US East (N. Virginia) in the beginning (not Oregon which is the default). This is extremely important otherwise your code may not work and you may be charged extra.</p></blockquote><h4 id="Goal-1"><a href="#Goal-1" class="headerlink" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h4><p>For each unique bigram, compute its average number of appearances per book, with at least 50 occurrences for each recorded year. For the above example, the results will be:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I am       (<span class="number">342</span> + <span class="number">211</span>) / (<span class="number">90</span> + <span class="number">10</span>) = <span class="number">5.53</span></span><br><span class="line">very cool  (<span class="number">500</span> + <span class="number">3210</span> + <span class="number">9994</span>) / (<span class="number">10</span> + <span class="number">1000</span> + <span class="number">3020</span>) = <span class="number">3.40049628</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Output the 10 bigrams having the highest average number of appearances per book along with their corresponding averages, in tab-separated format​, sorted in descending order, with at least 50 occurrences for each recorded year. If multiple bigrams have the same average, order them alphabetically. For the example above, the output will be:<br><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="selector-tag">I</span> <span class="selector-tag">am</span>       5<span class="selector-class">.53</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="selector-tag">very</span> <span class="selector-tag">cool</span>  3<span class="selector-class">.40049628</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>You will solve this problem by writing a PIG script on Amazon EC2 and save the output.</p><p>You can use the interactive PIG shell provided by EMR to perform this task from the command line (grunt). In this case, you can copy the commands you used for this task into a single file to have the PIG script and the output from the command line into a separate file. Please see this for how to use PIG shell. Also, you can upload the script and create a task on your cluster.</p><h3 id="Task-4-Analyzing-a-Large-Graph-using-Hadoop-service-onMicrosoft-Azure"><a href="#Task-4-Analyzing-a-Large-Graph-using-Hadoop-service-onMicrosoft-Azure" class="headerlink" title="Task 4: Analyzing a Large Graph using Hadoop service onMicrosoft Azure"></a>Task 4: Analyzing a Large Graph using Hadoop service onMicrosoft Azure</h3><h4 id="Goal-2"><a href="#Goal-2" class="headerlink" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h4><p>Your task is to write a MapReduce program to calculate the degree distribution of a graph. Note that this task shares some similarities with Task 1 (e.g., both are analyzing graphs). Task 1 can be completed using your own computer. This task is to be completed using Azure. We recommend that you first complete Task 1.</p><p>You will use data files small.tsv(~75MB) and large.tsv(~3GB), for this question. Each file stores a list of edges as tab-separated-values. Each line represents a single edge consisting of two columns: (Node A, Node B), each of which is separated by a tab. Node IDs are positive integers and the rows are already sorted by Node A.<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">src  tgt</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">130</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">194</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">51</span>   <span class="number">299</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">130</span>  <span class="number">200</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">151</span>  <span class="number">230</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">151</span>  <span class="number">194</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Your code should accept two arguments upon running.

For instance two rational numbers can be added, subtracted from, multiplied and divided. When adding and subtracting two rational numbers, the denominators first need to be reduced to a common denominator.

In this problem, you will create an index for a text but, instead of the page number, you will use the line numbers. You are to implement the function index (fname, letter) that takes as input the name of the text file and the first letter of the words for which you are to create the line number index. For each word that begins with ‘letter’, you are to print the corresponding line numbers. You should</p><ol><li>open and read the file only once; use readline()</li><li>Remove all punctuation from the text</li><li>For each word that begins with the specified letter, find all the line numbers in which the letter appears.</li><li>Print the total number of lines in the text and the number of words that begin with the specified letter.</li></ol><p>Use a dictionary to store results {word: list of line number(s)}. For each word, a line number should be listed only once, for example, ‘the’ appears 3 time on line 250; 250 should not be listed 3 times, only once. In the output, the line numbers should be separated by commas, but they are not printed as lists (no brackets). The words in the output should be in alphabetical order, i.e. a - z.</p><h4 id="Random-problem"><a href="#Random-problem" class="headerlink" title="Random problem"></a>Random problem</h4><p>Craps is a dice-based game played in many casinos. The game starts with the player throwing a pair of standard, six-sided dice. If the player rolls a total of 7 or 11, the player wins. If the player rolls a total of 2, 3 or 12, the player loses. For all other roll values, the player will repeatedly roll the pair of dice until either she rolls the initial value again (in which case she wins) or 7 (in which case she loses. Write a function craps() that takes no arguments, simulates one game of craps, and returns ‘I win’ if the player won and ‘I lost’ if the player lost. Consider implementing a second function if the player does not win or lose on the initial roll.</p><h4 id="Dictionary-problem"><a href="#Dictionary-problem" class="headerlink" title="Dictionary problem"></a>Dictionary problem</h4><p>Implement a function STUDENT() which allows the user to enter the 7-digit student ID. The program will keep prompting the user for a last name and first name. If the student does not have a student ID on record, the program will then ask for the student ID, and store that information. If the student already has a student ID, the program will display it, and ask for confirmation whether a new studentID should be assigned (and, if so allows the new studentID to be entered). When the user hits the return key, the program prints a report listing all students with their studentID. Your report does not have to be in alphabetical order, however, if you do want to make it alphabetical, you can use sorted on the keys() of your dictionary.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>The goal of this assignment is to give you experience running and experimenting with heuristic search code. There are three main components. The first is on tiebreaking in A<em> , the second is on tiebreaking in WA</em> and GBFS, and the third is on re-expansions in WA* and GBFS.</p><p>For this assignment, you are provided with C++ code for generic best-first search and A*, as well as for code for working with the map pathfinding and the 3 × 4 sliding tile puzzle domains. You are strongly encourage to use this code, though you are free to complete the experiments in whatever language you so choose. If you choose to use your own code, you will need to use the following input files, which have been provided (see the framework documentation for information on the format of these files):</p><ul><li>“starcraft bgh.map” is a file representation of a map to run experiments on.</li><li>“starcraft bgh.probs” is a file containing a list of pathfinding problems for the map given by “starcraft bgh.map.”</li><li>“3x4 puzzle.probs” is a list of start states for experiments on the 3 × 4 sliding tile puzzle domain.</li></ul><p>All sections have both an experimental and theoretical component. For the theoretical component, feel free to use any of the theorems or lemmas we have already discussed in class.</p><p>Finally, note that different authors sometimes define a count of the number of node expansions slightly differently. For this assignment, we will count the number of node expansions as the number of times a node is taken off the open list, or equivalently, the number of calls to the goal test function that are performed.</p><h3 id="Tiebreaking-in-A"><a href="#Tiebreaking-in-A" class="headerlink" title="Tiebreaking in A*"></a>Tiebreaking in A*</h3><p>The first part of this assignment is on the importance of tiebreaking in A<em>. By default, A</em> compares nodes according to the evaluation f(n) = g(n) + h(n), called the f-value, and no other criteria. Ties are then dealt with arbitrarily (usually just by their ordering in the comparison). In the rest of this document, we refer to this as the Default tiebreaking rule. For the following experiments, we also define the following two different methods, each of which you will have to implement:</p><ul><li>If there is a tie in the f-value between two nodes, the node with the lower value of g(n) (i.e. the g-cost) is considered “best. We call this tiebreaking rule, Low-G tiebreaking.</li><li>If there is a tie in the f-cost between two nodes, the node with the higher g-cost is considered best. We call this tiebreaking rule, High-G tiebreaking.</li></ul><p>You are now required to complete the following tasks:</p><ol><li><p>Create an empty grid map of size 20 × 20. This means there are no obstacles. Set the map to be 4-connected, which means that in any location, the agent can only move in the 4 cardinal directions (i.e., north, east, south, and west) provided there is no obstacle in the way or they are prevented from moving in a given direction because they are at the boundary of the map. Consider the task of finding a path from location (1,10) and to location (11, 10). Run A* with each of the three different tiebreaking rules on this problem (Default, Low-G, and High-G). In at most two sentences, describe how the different tiebreaking rules compare in terms of nodes expanded.</p></li><li><p>Run the same experiment as in 1(a), except this time set the goal state to location (6, 15). In at most three sentences, describe how the results compare to those seen in the experiment in 1(a).</p></li><li><p>Notice that because there are no obstacles the Manhattan distance heuristic provides perfect estimates on the empty 20 × 20 grid map that you constructed. Also notice that the optimal solution cost to the tasks in questions 1(a) and 1(b) are the same. In no more than four sentences, explain why the relative performance of Low-G and High-G tiebreaking differs between these two problems, and what these experiments suggest about the best way to do tiebreaking when using A*.</p></li><li><p>Run A* with each of the three different tiebreaking rules on the 100 pathfinding problems given in file “starcraft bgh.probs” on the map given in file “starcraft bgh.map”. Make a table that shows the average number of nodes expanded when using each rule, the median number of nodes expanded, and the percentage of problems for which each tiebreaking rule is the best. In at most two sentences, describe if the results are consistent with the conclusions you made in question 1(c).</p></li><li><p>Let α and β be two instances of A<em> that are identical aside from their tiebreaking policy, and both use the same consistent heuristic. Prove that if some node n is expanded by α before a goal is found, while β does not expand n before a goal is found, then f(n) = C</em>.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Tiebreaking-in-WA-and-GBFS"><a href="#Tiebreaking-in-WA-and-GBFS" class="headerlink" title="Tiebreaking in WA* and GBFS"></a>Tiebreaking in WA* and GBFS</h3><p>The second part of this assignment is on the importance of tiebreaking in WA<em> and GBFS. If you are using the provided code, this means you must extend the given best-first search code to create instances of WA</em> and GBFS.</p><ol><li><p>Repeat the experiments in questions 1(a) and 1(b) with WA<em> (use weights 2 and 5) and GBFS. In no more than 5 sentences, explain if the same trends hold as with A</em>, and why or why not.</p></li><li><p>Consider the set of 100 3 × 4 sliding tile puzzle problems given. Run WA<em> using weights 1, 2, 5, 10, and 100, and GBFS, each using the three different tiebreaking strategies to solve these problems. Make a table that shows the average number of node expansions, the median number of node expansions, and the percentage of problems for which each tiebreaking rule runs the fastest (per weight). Make a second table that shows the average solution cost, the median solution cost, and the percentage of problems for which each tiebreaking rule finds the best solution. In at most 4 sentences, describe what these experiments suggest is the best way to do tiebreaking in WA</em> and GBFS.</p></li><li><p>Even after applying the High-G and Low-G tiebreaking rules, there may still be ties. Add to your implementation the ability to break these remaining ties randomly. Take the problem from the 15-puzzle test set with the largest optimal solution cost, and solve it 100 times each with WA* with weights 1, 2, 5, 10, and GBFS. Use the best tiebreaking strategy seen in the above experiments for each algorithm. Show the average, median, and variance in terms of number of node expansions for each algorithm and weight. What is the general trend?</p></li><li><p>Let T(x, y) be a boolean function that returns true if node x is less than or equal to y and false otherwise (i.e., T is a tiebreaking rule). Consider any problem with a finite number of states. Let α be an instance of WA* that uses T to tiebreak, and let β be an instance of GBFS that uses the same heuristic as α, Low-G tiebreaking, and T to resolve any remaining ties. Prove that on any problem with a finite state-space, there exists a constant W such that if α uses a weight w ≥ W , then α and β will expand the exact same set of nodes in the exact same order until a solution is found.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Re-expansions-in-WA-and-GBFS"><a href="#Re-expansions-in-WA-and-GBFS" class="headerlink" title="Re-expansions in WA* and GBFS"></a>Re-expansions in WA* and GBFS</h3><p>The third part of the assignment is on the impact of re-expansions in WA<em> and GBFS. For this part of the assignment, you will have to modify the code, so that it has the option to not reopen nodes when a lower-cost path is found to a state. For clarity, we refer to a WA</em> or GBFS that does reopen nodes as rWA<em> and rGBFS, respectively, and a WA</em> or GBFS that does not reopen nodes as nrWA* and nrGBFS, respectively.</p><ol><li><p>Run nrGBFS and nrWA* with weights 2, 5, and 10, on the 100 15-puzzle problems and create a table that shows the average and median number of node expansions, and the average and median solution costs. For each algorithm, use the best tiebreaking rule as seen in 2(b). In at most three sentences, describe how the results compare to those seen in question 2(b).</p></li><li><p>Using the results from the runs in 3(a) and 2(b), make a table that shows, for each weight, the percentage of problems for which rWA<em> expanded fewer nodes than nrWA</em> (as well as vice versa and ties), and the percentage of problems for which rWA<em> found solutions of lower cost than nrWA</em> (as well as vice versa and ties). Construct a similar table for rGBFS and nrGBFS.</p></li><li><p>Run rWA* with weights, 2, 5, and 10 on the 100 pathfinding problems given for map “starcraft bgh.map”. Make a table that shows the average number of nodes expanded (including reexpansions), the average number of unique state expansions (i.e., the average number of states expanded at least once), the median number of node expansions, and the median number of unique state expansions.</p></li><li><p>Run nrGBFS and nrWA* with weights 2, 5, and 10 on the 100 pathfinding problems given for map “starcraft bgh.map”. Make a table that shows the average number of nodes expanded and the median number of node expansions. How do the results compare with those seen in question 3(c)?</p></li><li><p>Prove that if the heuristic nrWA<em> using weight w &gt;= 1 is using a consistent heuristic, then any solution it finds will have a cost of no more than w·C</em>.</p></li></ol>]]></content>
