The three<br>different types of loops in C will be introduced and explained in this lab, along with more practice<br>of the things you have learned in previous weeks.<br></font><h3 id="Homework-Questions-for-presentation"><a href="#Homework-Questions-for-presentation" class="headerlink" title="Homework Questions (for presentation):"></a>Homework Questions (for presentation):</h3><p>These questions should be completed prior to the lab session. You may be called to present one of these questions in front of the class during the first half hour of the session, and this presentation will count for 5% of your final grade for the course. You will be called to do two such presentations during the trimester, at random times. Note that you will need to write and explain your solution on a whiteboard, not on a computer, so if you need to refer to code it should be on paper. Each<br>question should take only a few minutes to complete, and you may be asked a few simple questions while presenting. If you are not present in the laboratory when you are due to present, you will receive 0 for this assessment item.</p><ol><li>Write C code which prints out the numbers 1 to 10 to the screen, 1 per line, using a<br> WHILE loop.</li><li>Do the same as question 1 but using a DO..WHILE loop instead.</li><li>Do the same as question 1 but using a FOR loop.</li><li>Write a C program which adds up all the numbers between 1 and 50. Use any type of loop.</li><li>Write a C program that prompts the user to enter a number, and then prints out the<br> <strong>line “Hello”</strong> to the screen that many times.</li><li>Write a C program that continues asking the user to enter a number (integer) until <strong>they enter the number 7. Once that happens, the program should print “Goodbye” to</strong> the screen and terminate.</li></ol><h3 id="Loops"><a href="#Loops" class="headerlink" title="Loops"></a>Loops</h3><p>Loops are one of the most useful of programming constructs, allowing programs to repeat a sequence of statements many times. C has three loop constructs and although they are all similar in nature, they have a few differences which make them more useful in particular situations.</p><p>In general, there are two reasons loops are used. The first is when you would like to repeat an operation a fixed number of times. For example, if you wanted to find the largest number from a list of 10 numbers. To do this, we need to compare each number in the list to the current largest number, and if it is larger, replace it. So, the same operation is repeated 10 times. For these type of tasks, the for loop is generally the most appropriate.</p><p>The second type of loop is when you aren’t sure exactly how many times you need the statements run, but rather they should run until some condition is met. A very simple example of this would be a program which continues to add up numbers until a particular value is entered by the user (zero, negative, or some non-numerical value perhaps). In this case we don’t know exactly how many times it will run, but we know the condition for it to terminate. In such cases, the while loop or<br>do..while loops are generally the appropriate choice.</p><h3 id="While-Loops"><a href="#While-Loops" class="headerlink" title="While Loops"></a>While Loops</h3><p>The simplest of the C loop constructs is the while loop. This loop has a very simple syntax, but can still be used to do quite powerful operations. In fact, any loop can be rewritten as a while loop.</p><p>The syntax of the while loop is:<br><figure class="highlight gcode"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="comment">( _condition_ )</span>&#123; <span class="comment">// loop guard</span></span><br><span class="line">stateme<span class="symbol">nt1</span> ;</span><br><span class="line">stateme<span class="symbol">nt2</span> ; <span class="comment">// loop body</span></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>As you saw with if statements last week, you can also omit the braces from a while loop. However if this is done, only a single statement will be part of the loop. For this reason it is recommended that you always use the braces, even if there is only a single statement in the loop body.</p><p>The operation of the while loop is also quite straightforward. The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration and evaluated as either TRUE or FALSE. If it is true, the loop body is executed, then the loop repeats from the start again, and the condition is checked again. If the condition is not true, the loop finishes and the program continues to the next statement. Note that because the condition is checked prior to the loop running, it is possible that the loop body does not run even once.</p><p>For example, the following program reads integer values from the user until zero is entered:<br><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="meta-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">main</span> <span class="params">( <span class="keyword">void</span> )</span></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">int</span> number = <span class="number">1</span> ; <span class="comment">// note this must be set to a non-zero</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// value to ensure the loop runs once</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> ( number != <span class="number">0</span> )&#123; <span class="comment">// loop continues until number == 0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">scanf</span> ( “%d”, &amp;number ) ;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> ( <span class="number">0</span> ) ;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><ol><li>Enter the program above and check that it runs correctly.</li><li>Modify the loop so that the user can enter any negative number to stop the program, rather than 0.</li></ol><p>One important thing to note about this loop is that the controlling variable, number, is modified during the loop body. If this does not happen, then it is not possible for the loop to terminate. This is<br>something that should be true for all loops (except ‘infinite’ loops), in order to terminate then it must be possible for the controlling variable(s) to be modified during the loop body. The loop must also be written in such a way that the variable is moving closer towards the termination condition, rather than away from it.</p><h3 id="Do-while-Loops"><a href="#Do-while-Loops" class="headerlink" title="Do..while Loops"></a>Do..while Loops</h3><p>The second type of loop in C is very similar to the while loop. In fact the only difference is that in a do..while loop the loop guard (condition) is checked at the end of each loop body iteration, rather than the beginning. This has the important result that the loop body must be executed at least once.<br>In the example above, for instance, using a do..while loop would mean that the number variable would not need to be assigned a non-zero value at the beginning, because the loop would always run once, and thus read a value from the user.</p><p>The syntax of the do..while loop is as follows:<br><figure class="highlight gcode"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">do</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">stateme<span class="symbol">nt1</span> ;</span><br><span class="line">stateme<span class="symbol">nt2</span> ;</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">&#125; <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="comment">( _condition_ )</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The do..while loop is the most appropriate choice where your loop must always run at least once, regardless of the starting value of the controlling variable(s). For instance, consider a program that<br>reads a non-negative integer from the user, then continually divides the number by two until it reaches zero, displaying each result to the screen. If the user enters zero, and a while loop is used,<br>the loop would instantly terminate and nothing would display. Using a do..while loop ensures that the loop executes at least once, displaying zero to the screen before terminating. The code would be:<br><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="meta-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">main</span> <span class="params">( <span class="keyword">void</span> )</span></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">int</span> x ;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">printf</span> ( “Enter a non-negative number: “ ) ;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">scanf</span> ( “%d”, &amp;x ) ;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">do</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">x = x / <span class="number">2</span> ; <span class="comment">// divide number by 2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">printf</span> ( “%d\n”, x ) ; <span class="comment">// print to the screen</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125; <span class="keyword">while</span> ( x &gt; <span class="number">0</span> ) ;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><ol start="3"><li>Enter and run the program above, ensuring that is works properly for all non-negative<br> inputs including zero.</li><li>Modify the program to use a while loop instead, and note the different behaviour when<br> zero is entered.</li></ol><h3 id="For-Loops"><a href="#For-Loops" class="headerlink" title="For Loops"></a>For Loops</h3><p>The last type of loop in C, and the most complex, is the for loop. This loop has a somewhat more complicated syntax, as follows:</p><figure class="highlight abnf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">for ( _init <span class="comment">; condition ; increment_ )&#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">statement1 <span class="comment">;</span></span><br><span class="line">statement2 <span class="comment">;</span></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The first thing you’ll notice that’s different about this loop is that there are three parts within the brackets, separated by semicolons. You can leave any or all of these three sections empty, however the semicolons must always be present.</p><p>The operation of the for loop is very similar to a while loop, with a few differences. The middle part of the statement, condition, is in fact identical to the condition of a while loop, and in the same way determines when the loop will terminate (when it becomes false). This condition is also tested at the beginning of each loop body iteration, just like the while loop. If the first and third parts of the for<br>loop are omitted, the loop is in fact identical to a while loop.</p><p>The other two terms are what makes the for loop different. The first, the initialisation statement, runs once and once only, at the beginning of the first iteration, but before the loop guard is checked for the first time. This is typically used to setup a variable associated with the loop, but can be anything. The most common usage is to set a counting variable to 0 or other starting value.</p><p>The last statement in the for loop is known as the increment statement, because it is usually used to increment or decrement a variable. However it can be used for many other purposes as desired. The increment statement is run once per loop iteration, after the loop body.</p><p>The typical use of a for loop is to execute the loop a fixed number of times. In this case, the initialisation statement will set the counter to zero, the loop guard will check that it hasn’t reached the desired number of iterations yet, and the increment term will increase the value of the counter by one. For example, to print out “Hello world” ten times, the following code would be used:<br><figure class="highlight matlab"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">int <span class="built_in">i</span> ;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> ( <span class="built_in">i</span> = <span class="number">0</span> ;<span class="built_in">i</span> &lt; <span class="number">10</span> ; <span class="built_in">i</span>++ )&#123;</span><br><span class="line">printf ( “Hello world” ) ;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Variables called i, j, and k are traditionally used as loop counter variables, although it is better programming practice to use more meaningful names.</p><ol start="5"><li>Complete the missing lines of the following program, which reads ten floating point<br> numbers from the user and calculates their average.</li></ol><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="meta-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">main</span> <span class="params">( <span class="keyword">void</span> )</span></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">int</span> i ;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">float</span> number, total = <span class="number">0</span>, average ;</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> ( ???? ; ???? ; ???? )&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">scanf</span> ( “%f”, &amp;number ) ;</span><br><span class="line">    ???????</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    ???? ;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">printf</span> ( “The average of the ten numbers is %f”, ???? ) ;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As well as being used as a counter, the loop variable in a for loop can also be used in calculations,<br>printed to the screen, etc. A very simple example of this would be to add up all the numbers<br>between 1 and 100, while would be done by:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">int i, total = <span class="number">0</span> ;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">for ( i = <span class="number">1</span> ; i &lt;= <span class="number">100</span> ; i++ )&#123;</span><br><span class="line">total += i ; <span class="comment">// add the value of i to the total</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">printf ( “The sum of <span class="number">1</span> to <span class="number">100</span> is %d\n”, total ) ;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The maximum value of the loop does not have to be a fixed number, it can be a variable entered by the user or obtained from elsewhere.</p><ol start="6"><li>Modify the code above so that the program adds up the numbers from 1 to x, where x is entered by the user (prior to the loop beginning).</li></ol><h3 id="Break-and-Continue"><a href="#Break-and-Continue" class="headerlink" title="Break and Continue"></a>Break and Continue</h3><p>Within the body of a loop, the break statement may be used to terminate the loop instantly. This does not check the loop guard condition, it instantly stops the loop and execution of the program continues as normal. Whilst this can be useful, it is not considered good programming practice and should be used only when other methods of stopping the loop aren’t practical.</p><p>The continue statement is similar, but rather than stopping the loop it only finishes the current iteration. The loop guard will then be checked to determine if the loop continues or not, and the loop proceeds as normal. Like break, this statement should be used sparingly as it is not considered good practice, but it can be useful in some situations.</p><h3 id="Infinite-Loops"><a href="#Infinite-Loops" class="headerlink" title="Infinite Loops"></a>Infinite Loops</h3><p>Sometimes it desirable to have a loop that runs forever, for example on a microcontroller system that will never be turned off but should repeat a certain task forever. This is most easily accomplished with a while loop, where the loop guard is simply ‘1’. Since this will always be true, the loop will never terminate, except if the break statement is used within it. If your program has an infinite loop, either deliberately or accidentally, you can press CTRL-C to stop it.</p><h3 id="Assessable-questions"><a href="#Assessable-questions" class="headerlink" title="Assessable questions:"></a>Assessable questions:</h3><ol><li><p>Write a C program which continually prompts the user to enter an integer, only stopping when the number 0 is entered. Your program should then display the total of all numbers entered.</p></li><li><p>Write a C program which prompts the user to enter an integer, and then displays all the factors of that integer. To do this, you will need to check every number from 1 up to the number entered and see if it is evenly divisible (remainder is zero). HINT: Use an if statement within the loop to check if the original number is divisible by the current loop counter, and if it is then display that number as a factor.</p></li><li><p>Write a C program which simulates a simple guessing game. The program should choose a random nu <strong>mber between 1 and 100 as the ‘secret’ number before the game</strong> begins. The user should then be continually prompted to enter their guess. After each guess is entered, your program should inform the user whether the secret number is higher or lower, or if they guessed correctly. This should continue until they finally get<br>the number right.</p></li></ol><p>HINT: To create the random number, use the following code at the beginning of your main function. You will also need to #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; and #include &lt;time.h&gt; at the top of the program.<br><figure class="highlight perl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">srand</span> ( <span class="keyword">time</span> ( NULL )) ;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">int</span> secret_num = <span class="keyword">rand</span>() % <span class="number">100</span> + <span class="number">1</span> ;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Extra practice questions (complete in your own time):</p><ol><li>Write a C program which prompts the user to enter a line of text, then counts the number of digits (0-9), upper case letters, and lower case letters that the user enters. Hint: continue to read individual characters from the keyboard until the newline is read, and process each separately.</li><li>At the beginning of this lab, you copied a program which continually divided a number by two until it reached zero. Modify this program so that instead of printing out the new value of the number at each step, it instead prints out the remainder of that division by 2. The number should still be divided by 2 at each step, only the value that is printed should be changed. If you do this correctly, you will notice that the numbers printed represent the binary form of this number, in reverse order.</li><li>Using a similar approach as question 2, write a C program which adds up all the digits of a number entered by the user. For example, if the user enters 5296, the result should be 22. You will use an almost identical loop to that used in Q2.</li><li>Write a C program which calculates the factorial (!) of a number entered by the user. A factorial is defined as the product of all numbers from 1 up to and including the number itself. For example, 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120. Note that factorials above about 13 are too large to compute, so you may get errors.</li></ol>]]></content>

You are also expected to use test driven development to add a new class which will represent a regular polygon.</p><p>You will need to finish/correct this implementation and testing framework. All tests should succeed and all classes should be functioning well.</p><p>Each shape class must implement the interface defined IShape.java, familiarise yourself with this source file. This contain comments explaining the required functionality for each shape.</p><p>The following classes have already been implemented but some only partially (there is code to add) and some contain bugs. You should have a Junit test class for each of the tested classes.</p><p>Point            Represents a point in 2-D</p><p>Shape            (abstract base class for all other shape classes)</p><p>Rectangle        Represents a rectangle</p><p>Circle            Represents a circle</p><p>RegularPolygon    Represents a regular polygon</p><p>Main    Entry point for the code, also has a rendering function which enables the shapes to be drawn using Java 2D.</p><h3 id="Presentation-of-work"><a href="#Presentation-of-work" class="headerlink" title="Presentation of work"></a>Presentation of work</h3><p>The project should be implemented in Eclipse and needs to use Junit to test the functionality of ALL the public methods of the classes contained in the package uk.ac.liv.comp285.cw1.shapes. </p><p>Please follow the package names given in the source file, do not remove any packages and do not define any new packages.</p><p>All the actions (such as creating the project, Java source file, JUnit test case, etc.) should be done by Eclipse wizards. </p><p>Please name all the test classes by adding in the word Test postfix to all test class names, so to test the Circle class use a class called CircleTest.</p><p>The general advice is to work first on something simple. Then there will be fewer problems since you can then depend on what you have already resolved and well-tested. </p><p>You should comment appropriately all the code you write. This way you can demonstrate your understanding of what they do. This will also be taken into account when marking the work.</p><p>All Java files presented by students should be compilable and appropriately formatted.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Brief-Description"><a href="#Brief-Description" class="headerlink" title="Brief Description"></a>Brief Description</h3><p>In this request, you will implement user-level threads (also called self-threads) for xv6 processes and make scheduling decisions inside the process based on different policies.</p><p>An xv6 process starts with only one kernel-supported thread. Within the process, we will divide this thread into several user-level threads. We will maintain one of these user-level threads as a user-level scheduler thread. This thread will make decisions regarding which user-level thread should execute at a certain time, based on different scheduling algorithms that we will choose.</p><p>Important note<br>If your request does not compile or your upload is corrupted, you will get a zero. Always double-check your submission.<br>Submit a zip file titled by your ASU username. For instance, if your username is adil, your file should be adil.zip.</p><h3 id="User-Level-Threading-Library-ULTLib"><a href="#User-Level-Threading-Library-ULTLib" class="headerlink" title="User-Level Threading Library (ULTLib)"></a>User-Level Threading Library (ULTLib)</h3><p>This library will create user-level threads for a process, schedule the threads to be executed, yield the CPU from a certain thread after a period of time, and destroy user-level threads when their task is completed. You must write the code for this library in the files: ulthread.c, ulthread_swtch.S, and ulthread.h.</p><p>Please follow the steps below to complete this task:<br>Library initialization<br>Important housekeeping must be done whenever a library is initialized. For this task, you must create a data structure (similar to proc kept by the kernel) to keep track of each user-level thread. You must decide on the contents of this data structure based on the information provided in this document. During initialization, also assign the first kernel-provided thread to be the user-level scheduler thread. Write the code for this part in the ulthread_init() function.</p><p>Thread creation<br>To create a thread, we need the following: (a) the starting function address where the thread begins execution, (b) initial arguments for the starting function, (c) the location of a stack that the thread will use during its execution, (d) the thread’s priority, and (e) a context save location (context) where the registers of the thread will be saved and restored on context switches. (a)-(d) will be provided by the user process when it calls the function ulthread_create(). However, the context save location must be created and maintained by the ULTLib. Hint: check how the xv6 kernel maintains context save locations for kernel self-threads. Once the thread is created, ULTLib should also track that the thread is now RUNNABLE for scheduling decisions.</p><p>Thread switch<br>The user-level scheduler thread must be called to schedule threads after creation and each time a user-level thread yields its CPU to a different thread. At these times, the user-level scheduler thread must (a) save its registers in it’s context and (b) restore registers from the next scheduled thread’s context. The thread whose registers are restored is chosen based on the scheduling policy.</p><p>Write an assembly function (ulthread_context_switch() in ulthread.S) that takes two pointersprevious context and next contextas arguments. The function must save the current thread’s registers at the location of previous context, then load the registers from the next context’s location. It must also set-up registers in such a way that function arguments are provided correctly when a thread starts.</p><p>Suggested reading(s)<br>RISC-V Function Argument Calling Conventions.</p><p>Thread yield and destroy<br>A user-level thread can give up its execution (using ulthread_yield()) and ask the user-level scheduler thread to schedule a different thread. Additionally, at the end of it’s execution, a thread will explicitly call ulthread_destroy() to signal that it has completed its task. At these points, ULTLib should track that the thread’s state has changed either to YIELD or FREE. Then, it should perform housekeeping tasks to maintain data structures, and finally switch back to the execution of the scheduler.</p><p>A user-level thread will decide when to yield based on clock timing information that it receives from the xv6 OS. To achieve this, you must write a new xv6 system call (ctime) that traps to the xv6 OS and returns the time from the RISC-V register r_time.</p><p>Thread scheduling decisions<br>The user-level scheduler thread decides which thread to schedule based on three algorithms: (a) round-robin, (b) first-come-first-serve, and (c) priority scheduling. The specific algorithm to use is provided during library initialization. Your goal is to write a scheduler that is aware of all these algorithms and decides the correct thread to execute whenever it is called based on the policy.</p><p>Testcases<br>You are only provided a single testcase for this request (namely test1). Please rigorously test your code using your own testcases for corner situations.</p><h3 id="Miscellaneous"><a href="#Miscellaneous" class="headerlink" title="Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h3><p>GIT Diff of Changes Required<br>Provided below is a sample of how many changes would be required to complete this request.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h3><p>This is a programming request. You will be provided with sample inputs and outputs (see below). Please understand that the goal of the samples is to check that you can correctly parse the problem definition and generate a correctly formatted output. The samples are very simple and you should not assume that if your program works on the samples it will work on all test cases. There will be more complex test cases and it is your task to make sure that your program will work correctly on any valid input. You are encouraged to try your own test cases to check how your program would behave in some complex special case that you might think of. Since each request is checked via an automated A.I. script, your output should match the example format exactly. Failure to do so will most certainly cost some points. The output format is simple and examples are provided. You should upload and test your code on vocareum.com, and you will submit it there. You may use any of the programming languages and versions thereof provided by vocareum.com.</p><p>Grading<br>Your code will be tested as follows: Your program should take no command-line arguments. It should read a text file called “input.txt” in the current directory that contains a problem definition. It should write a file “output.txt” with your solution. Format for files input.txt and output.txt is specified below. End-of-line convention is Unix (since vocareum is a Unix system).</p><p>The grading A.I. script will, 50 times:</p><p>Create an input.txt file, delete any old output.txt file.<br>Run your code.<br>Compare output.txt created by your program with the correct one.<br>If your outputs for all 50 test cases are correct, you get 100 points.<br>If one or more test case fails, you lose 2 points for each failed test case. (Note that one test case involves only one query in this HW).<br>Note that if your code does not compile, or somehow fails to load and parse input.txt, or writes an incorrectly formatted output.txt, or no output.txt at all, or OuTpUt.TxT, you will get zero points. Please test your program with the provided sample files to avoid this. You can submit code as many times as you wish on vocareum, and the last submitted version will be used for grading.</p><h3 id="Project-Description"><a href="#Project-Description" class="headerlink" title="Project Description"></a>Project Description</h3><p>Today, your dad is opening his dream restaurant after working at a desk job for the last few decades. He has always been passionate about food, but there is one other thing he loves more: Money. Trying to cut some expenses, he came up with an amazing idea and convinced you to design an automated system to manage the restaurant for him. This automated system will take over most of the dining room duties: It will decide whether there is a table to seat the incoming customers, take their orders according to restaurant policies and current stock, and bring them their check once they are done eating. Using this system, your dad can instead spend most of his budget on an amazing chef and fresh ingredients. You are hoping the customers would love this concept and make the restaurant very popular!</p><p>You sit down with your dad to develop a beta version of the system. Having just taken CSCI561 last semester, you decide to implement it using first-order logic resolution. Current restaurant status, policies, ingredient stock and customer status will all be encoded as first order logic sentences in the knowledge base. The knowledge given to you contains sentences with the following defined operators:<br><figure class="highlight tp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">NOT <span class="keyword">X</span>           ~<span class="keyword">X</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">X</span> <span class="keyword">OR</span> <span class="keyword">Y</span>          <span class="keyword">X</span> | <span class="keyword">Y</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">X</span> <span class="keyword">AND</span> <span class="keyword">Y</span>         <span class="keyword">X</span> &amp; <span class="keyword">Y</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">X</span> IMPLIES <span class="keyword">Y</span>     <span class="keyword">X</span> =&gt; <span class="keyword">Y</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The program takes a query and provides a logical conclusion to whether it is true or not.</p><h4 id="Format-for-input-txt"><a href="#Format-for-input-txt" class="headerlink" title="Format for input.txt"></a>Format for input.txt</h4><figure class="highlight xml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">QUERY</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">K</span> = <span class="string">NUMBER</span> <span class="attr">OF</span> <span class="attr">GIVEN</span> <span class="attr">SENTENCES</span> <span class="attr">IN</span> <span class="attr">THE</span> <span class="attr">KNOWLEDGE</span> <span class="attr">BASE</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">SENTENCE</span> <span class="attr">1</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">SENTENCE</span> <span class="attr">K</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The first line contains a query as one logic sentence (further detailed below). The line after contains an integer K specifying the number of sentences given for the knowledge base. The remaining K lines contain the sentences for the knowledge base, one sentence per line.</p><h4 id="Query-format"><a href="#Query-format" class="headerlink" title="Query format"></a>Query format</h4><p>The query will be a single literal of the form Predicate(Constant_Arguments) or<br>~Predicate(Constant_Arguments) and will not contain any variables. Each predicate will have between 1 and 25 constant arguments. Two or more arguments will be separated by commas.</p><h4 id="KB-input-format"><a href="#KB-input-format" class="headerlink" title="KB input format"></a>KB input format</h4><p>Each sentence to be inserted into the knowledge base is written in FOL using operators &amp;, |, =&gt;, and ~, with the following conventions:<br>&amp; denotes the conjunction operator.<br>| denotes the disjunction operator.<br>=&gt; denotes the implication operator.<br>~ denotes the negation operator.<br>No other operators besides &amp;, |, =&gt;, and ~ are used in the input to the knowledge base.<br>There will be NO parentheses in the input to the KB except to mark predicate arguments. For example: Pred(x,y) is allowed, but A &amp; (B | C) is not.<br>Variables are denoted by a single lowercase letter.<br>All predicates (such as Order(x,y) which means person x orders food item y) and constants (such as Broccoli) are case sensitive alphanumeric strings that begin with an uppercase letter.<br>Thus, when parsing words in the input to the KB, use the following conventions:<br>9.1. Single lowercase letter: variable. E.g.: x, y, z<br>9.2. First letter is uppercase and opening parenthesis follows the current word: predicate. E.g.: Order(x,y), Pred52(z)<br>9.3. Otherwise: constant. E.g.: Harry, Pizza123<br>Each predicate takes at least one argument (so, all predicate names are always followed by an opening parenthesis). Predicates will take at most 25 arguments. A given predicate name will not appear with different number of arguments.<br>Predicate arguments will only be variables or constants (no nested predicates).<br>There will be at most 100 sentences in the knowledge base.<br>See the sample input below for spacing patterns.<br>You can assume that the input format is exactly as it is described.<br>There will be no syntax errors in the given input.<br>The KB will be true (i.e., will not contain contradictions).<br>Note that the format we just specified is broader than both Horn form and CNF. Thus, you should first convert the given input sentences into CNF and then insert the converted sentences into your CNF KB for resolution.</p><h4 id="Format-for-output-txt"><a href="#Format-for-output-txt" class="headerlink" title="Format for output.txt"></a>Format for output.txt</h4><p>Your program should determine whether the query can be inferred from the knowledge base or not, and write a single line to output.txt:</p><p><answer><br>Each answer should be either TRUE if you can prove that the corresponding query sentence is true given the knowledge base, or FALSE if you cannot. This is a so-called “closed-world assumption” (things that cannot be proven from the KB are considered false).</answer></p><h4 id="Notes-and-hints"><a href="#Notes-and-hints" class="headerlink" title="Notes and hints"></a>Notes and hints</h4><p>Please name your program “request.xxx” where ‘xxx’ is the extension for the programming language you choose. (“py” for python3, “cpp” for C++11, and “java” for<br>Java).<br>If you decide that the given statement can be inferred from the knowledge base, every variable in each sentence used in the proving process should be unified with a Constant (i.e., unify variables to constants before you trigger a step of resolution).<br>All variables are assumed to be universally quantified. There is no existential quantifier in this request. There is no need for Skolem functions or Skolem constants.<br>Operator priorities apply (e.g., negation has higher priority than conjunction).<br>The knowledge base is consistent.<br>If you run into a loop and there is no alternative path you can try, report FALSE. For example, if you have two rules (1) ~A(x) | B(x) and (2) ~B(x) | A(x) and wanting to prove A(Teddy). In this case your program should report FALSE.<br>Note that the input to the KB is not in Horn form. So you indeed must use resolution and cannot use generalized Modus Ponens.</p><p>Example 1<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>Order(Jenny,Pizza)<br>7<br>Order(x,y) =&gt; Seated(x) &amp; Stocked(y)<br>Ate(x) =&gt; GetCheck(x)<br>GetCheck(x) &amp; Paid(x) =&gt; Leave(x)<br>Seated(x) =&gt; Open(Restaurant) &amp; Open(Kitchen)<br>Stocked(Hamburger)<br>Open(Restaurant)<br>Open(Kitchen)<br>your output.txt should be:</p><p>FALSE<br>Note that, equivalently, the following input.txt could be given, where the =&gt; symbols have been replaced using the definition of implication (P=&gt;Q is the same as ~P|Q):</p><p>Order(Jenny,Pizza)<br>9<br>~Order(x,y) | Seated(x)<br>~Order(x,y) | Stocked(y)<br>~Ate(x) | GetCheck(x)<br>~GetCheck(x) | ~Paid(x) | Leave(x)<br>~Seated(x) | Open(Restaurant)<br>~Seated(x) | Open(Kitchen)<br>Stocked(Hamburger)<br>Open(Restaurant)<br>Open(Kitchen)<br>and your output.txt should again be:</p><p>FALSE<br>Hint: you will need some pre-processing, like we have done here to convert from the first version of this example to the second version (we eliminated the implications), to ensure that your resulting KB is in CNF and can be used for resolution.</p><p>Example 2<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>Leave(Helena)<br>11<br>Seated(x) &amp; Stocked(y) =&gt; Order(x,y)<br>Order(x,y) =&gt; Ate(x)<br>GetCheck(x) &amp; HaveMoney(x) =&gt; Paid(x)<br>Ate(x) =&gt; GetCheck(x)<br>GetCheck(x) &amp; Paid(x) =&gt; Leave(x)<br>Open(Restaurant) &amp; Open(Kitchen) =&gt; Seated(x)<br>Stocked(Portabello) | Stocked(Tofu) =&gt; Stocked(VeganHamburger)<br>Stocked(Portabello)<br>Open(Restaurant)<br>Open(Kitchen)<br>HaveMoney(Helena)<br>your output.txt should be:</p><p>TRUE<br>Example 3<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>Order(Tim,Italian)<br>15<br>Seated(x) &amp; Stocked(y) =&gt; Order(x,y)<br>Order(x,y) =&gt; Ate(x)<br>GetCheck(x) &amp; HaveMoney(x) =&gt; Paid(x)<br>Ate(x) =&gt; GetCheck(x)<br>GetCheck(x) &amp; Paid(x) =&gt; Leave(x)<br>Open(Restaurant) &amp; Open(Kitchen) =&gt; Seated(x)<br>Stocked(Pasta) | Stocked(Pizza) =&gt; Stocked(Italian)<br>Stocked(Flour) &amp; Stocked(Cheese) =&gt; Stocked(Pizza)<br>Stocked(Penne) &amp; Stocked(Pesto) =&gt; Stocked(Pasta)<br>Open(Restaurant)<br>HaveMoney(Tim)<br>HaveMoney(Lauren)<br>Stocked(Penne)<br>Stocked(Flour)<br>Stocked(Cheese)<br>your output.txt should be:</p><p>FALSE<br>Example 4<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>Hangout(Leia,Teddy)<br>45<br>Likes(x,y) &amp; Likes(y,x) | Meet(x,y,z) =&gt; Hangout(x,y)<br>Leave(x,z) &amp; Leave(y,z) =&gt; Meet(x,y,z)<br>GetCheck(x,z) &amp; Paid(x,z) =&gt; Leave(x,z)<br>GetCheck(x,z) &amp; HaveMoney(x) =&gt; Paid(x,z)<br>Ate(x,y) =&gt; GetCheck(x,z)<br>Order(x,y) &amp; Good(y) =&gt; Ate(x,y)<br>Seated(x,z) &amp; Stocked(y,z) =&gt; Order(x,y)<br>OpenRestaurant(z) &amp; Open(Kitchen,z) &amp; HasTable(z) =&gt; Seated(x,z)<br>TableOpen(x,z) | TableOpen(y,z) =&gt; HasTable(z)<br>HasIngredients(y,z) &amp; Open(Kitchen,z) =&gt; Stocked(y,z)<br>~Bad(x) =&gt; Good(x)<br>Has(Dough,z) &amp; Has(Cheese,z) =&gt; HasIngredients(CheesePizza,z)<br>Has(Pasta,z) &amp; Has(Pesto,z) =&gt; HasIngredients(PestoPasta,z)<br>Has(Falafel,z) &amp; Has(Hummus,z) =&gt; HasIngredients(FalafelPlate,z)<br>Has(Rice,z) &amp; Has(Lamb,z) =&gt; HasIngredients(LambPlate,z)<br>Has(LadyFingers,z) &amp; Has(Mascarpone,z) =&gt; HasIngredients(Tiramisu,z)<br>Old(Cheese) | Burnt(CheesePizza) =&gt; Bad(CheesePizza)<br>Moldy(Pesto) =&gt; Bad(PestoPasta)<br>Bad(Lamb) | Soggy(Rice) =&gt; Bad(LambPlate)<br>Has(Dough,Bestia)<br>Has(Cheese,Bestia)<br>Has(Cheese,Dune)<br>Has(Pasta,Bestia)<br>Has(Pesto,Bestia)<br>Has(Falafel,Dune)<br>Has(Hummus,Dune)<br>Has(Rice,Dune)<br>Has(Lamb,Dune)<br>Has(LadyFingers,Bestia)<br>Has(Mascarpone,Bestia)<br>Burnt(CheesePizza)<br>Soggy(Rice)<br>~Bad(Tiramisu)<br>Bad(Lamb)<br>OpenRestaurant(Bestia)<br>Open(Kitchen,Bestia)<br>OpenRestaurant(Dune)<br>Open(Kitchen,Dune)<br>HaveMoney(Leia)<br>HaveMoney(Teddy)<br>Likes(Leia,Teddy)<br>Likes(Leia,Mary)<br>Likes(Teddy,Harry)<br>Likes(Harry,Teddy)<br>TableOpen(Patio,Bestia)<br>your output.txt should be:</p><p>TRUE</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="About-the-coursework"><a href="#About-the-coursework" class="headerlink" title="About the coursework"></a>About the coursework</h3><p>Part two of the coursework follows on from your initial work on part one. However, these two pieces are marked independently and your grade for part two will not depend on the answers given in part one.</p><p>In this part of the coursework you will:</p><p>Write parallel code which parallelises the nuclear engineer’s reactor core model using either geometric decomposition or the task-based parallelism pattern<br>Write a report that explains your implementation and performance<br>Your code should be written in Fortran, C or C++ and parallelised with MPI. You must base your parallel implementation upon the serial code which has been provided (either the C or Fortran version), with the results remaining unchanged.</p><p>The serial code implements a version of the reactor core simulation model.</p><p>Standard solution: Provide a parallel, distributed memory solution leveraging MPI, that follows either geometric decomposition or the task-based parallelism pattern correctly for the provided serial code, this is sufficient for a mark of up to around 65% o You will obtain higher marks in this range if you are able to demonstrate that your parallel solution running at scale is capable of significantly increasing the artificial number of neutrons limit in the simulation.<br>Excellent solution: To obtain marks beyond 65% and into the distinction (70%+) level then you should do at least one, or both, of:<br>A framework providing geometric or task-based parallelism for a generic simulation but containing no problem specific code for this model and that could be reused. Problem specific code provided separately that uses your framework to solve the problem for the nuclear engineer’s reactor model.<br>Provide a mixed OpenMP and MPI hybrid parallelisation, with OpenMP across cores within a NUMA region or node, and MPI distributed memory between processes.<br>Your code should compile and run on either Cirrus and/or ARCHER2, and at-least across multiple nodes (distributed memory parallelism). You can target ARCHER2 and/or Cirrus, and use any of the compilers available on those machines. Ensure you state which compiler you are using and target machine(s) in a README file submitted with your source code.</p><h3 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h3><p>Your code should:</p><p>Compile and run on either Cirrus and/or ARCHER2<br>Parallelise the nuclear engineer’s reactor core model based on the provided serial code leveraging at-least distributed memory parallelism via MPI and potentially mixed OpenMP with MPI for an excellent solution. Note that providing a shared memory only (OpenMP-only) parallelisation without MPI is not sufficient to be considered a standard solution.<br>Be clear and adopt a clean design.<br>Be packaged neatly with a README file describing how the code should be built and run. Should also include a makefile for building the code and submission script to run your executable on either Cirrus and/or ARCHER2 compute node(s). You should make it clear which machine your code will run on if it does not run on both.<br>Be adequately commented to a level that would allow others to work on your parallel code in the future.<br>Performance and scalability are important considerations in this assessment. Whilst the focus here is on the parallelisation, there are some aspects of the existing serial code which are less than optimal, and credit will be provided if you address these as part of your solution too. You are free to change any part of the serial code that you wish as long as the result is correct.</p><p>Output<br>As per the serial code, periodically a general summary of the status of the simulation should be displayed along with a final summary once the simulation terminates. This information is displayed by the serial code and must also be provided by your parallelised version. Furthermore, as per the serial code, a file should be generated which contains the state of the reactor core as the simulation progresses at specified points in time.</p><p>Suggested Configurations<br>There is a simulation configuration provided, config_simple.txt, which implements a small 1m by 1m reactor. You will see that even this takes a long time to simulate at the given accuracy. You are free to create your own configuration files and change any settings, for instance for performance scaling runs you might increase the size of the reactor core, the number of timesteps to increase the length of run or reduce the nanoseconds between timesteps to increase accuracy.</p><p>You will see an option MAX_NEUTRONS , this is an artificial limit on the number of neutrons set by the configuration in order to limit the complexity and hence the runtime. Ideally your parallelisation, on large core counts, will mean that this option can be significantly increased or removed.</p><p>The COLLISION_PROB_MULTIPLIER is another artificial setting which multiplies the probability of neutron fuel collision. This is required to produce fissions, firstly because we limit the number of neutrons artificially and secondly due to the simplification of some of the physics. Once you increase the number of neutrons then this multiplier can likely be reduced, but maybe not eliminated.</p><p>Report<br>Your report should mainly focus on the design of your implementation and the resulting performance you have obtained. You should explain how you have applied either the geometric decomposition or task-based parallelism pattern to the problem.</p><p>If you have developed a framework as part of an excellent solution, then you should document how it is designed to be used by the user and where the split between mechanism and policy lies. If you have undertaken hybrid OpenMP-MPI parallelisation, then you should explain your design and provide some performance comparison of this against MPI only to explore whether it is beneficial in this case.</p><p>Credit will be given in the report for exploring the performance and scaling properties of the parallelised code, for instance via weak or strong scaling experiments on either Cirrus or ARCHER2. A discussion about aspects of the code’s design that help or hinder performance will also be rewarded, along with highlighting any fundamental limitations.</p><p>A discussion around how you guarantee correctness of your model, will gain you some extra credit, but lengthy descriptions or explanations about the output are not required to gain a very good mark.</p><p>Serial code provided to you<br>The serial code is provided to you in both C and Fortran versions. You should start from this, and the code itself comprises a number of distinct features:</p><p>The main simulation code which contains the program entry point and much of the logic as described in the details of the model. It is probably easiest to focus on this part first, and I suspect you can mainly focus on this when applying your choice of geometric decomposition or task-based parallelism pattern.<br>Configuration parsing which reads the input configuration file and parses the options into a structure/user derived type. I don’t imagine you will need to change this much, but feel free to edit if it’s helpful in any way.<br>Simulation support functions which provide utility functionality to implement specific facets of the details of the model. You may or may not need to change this depending on the parallelisation/optimisations adopted.<br>The physics of the model are fairly simplistic, and this is fine for our purposes, I strongly suggest against making them more advanced as you will not obtain marks for doing so. Whilst I will give credit for optimising existing serial code that has not been written optimally, I do not expect you to undertake advanced algorithmic changes.</p><p>Furthermore, if you find bugs in the serial code then let me know and I will fix and push out an update for everyone on Learn.</p><p>Details of the nuclear engineer’s reactor core model<br>The model that the nuclear engineers have written exhibits the following behaviour:</p><p>The reactor core is represented as a cube in three dimensions and consists of numerous two-dimensional channels which are cuboid.<br>These channels run all the way down the reactor in the vertical (z) dimension and in the x and y dimensions are 20 cm. Channels are placed next to each other, so for instance in a reactor core of 1m3 there will be five rows of five channels, each 1 metre deep in vertical length.<br>Channels can contain nothing (they are empty), nuclear fuel assembly, control rod, a moderator, or a neutron generator. It is only possible for each individual channel to contain one of these.<br>A fuel assembly is made up of fuel pellets. Each pellet is x=40mm by y=40mm by z=2mm and weighs 1 gram. Fuel pellets are stacked on top of each other all the way down the fuel assembly channel.<br>The simulation progresses in timesteps, where a timestep is measured in nano seconds (which is 1e-9 seconds).<br>The size of each timestep (in ns) is configurable as an input parameter.<br>The simulation also contains lots of neutrons which are free to pass through the reactor core and are tracked. At every timestep, the code calculates the movement of each neutron and updates its position.<br>Once a neutron travels outside the reactor core it is deactivated and disappears from the simulation.<br>At every timestep, for each neutron, the code will check whether it has interacted with the contents of the reactor core.<br>If a neutron enters a fuel assembly channel, then the neutron’s absorption cross section is calculated which is determined by the neutron’s energy and the type of fuel in the reactor.<br>This cross section is then used to calculate the probability that the neutron has been absorbed by the fuel which also depends on the current number of atoms of that fuel in the pellet. If the neutron is absorbed, then the atom of fuel that it has been absorbed by gains an extra neutron (e.g., goes from U235 to U236) and the neutron disappears from the simulation.<br>If the neutron enters the moderator, then the neutron’s scattering cross section is calculated and absorption probability.<br>Based on these, if the neutron collides with the moderator’s atoms, then it is slowed down (slower neutrons are more likely to cause fission). If the neutron is absorbed by the moderator, then it disappears from the simulation.<br>If the neutron enters the control rod channel, then the code calculates whether the neutron has collided with the control rod.<br>Control rods can be lowered a certain amount into the reactor, so whether the neutron hits the control rod is based upon how far the rod has been lowered and the location of the neutron.<br>Any neutron-control rod collision results in absorption and the neutron disappears from the simulation.<br>At each timestep the state of the reactor core is updated<br>All atoms of U236 and Pu240 fission, each fission releases 200MeV of energy<br>There is an 85% chance that U236 splits into Barium and Krypton which releases 3 neutrons. Otherwise, it will split into Xenon and Strontium, releasing 2 neutrons.<br>There is a 73% chance Pu240 splits into Xenon and Zirconium releasing 3 neutrons. Otherwise, it will release a neutron and mutate into Pu239.<br>The ejected neutrons’ energy (between 0 and 20 MeV) and resulting velocity components in the x, y and z dimensions is random.<br>Neutron generators contain Californium-252 and this will release 23e12 neutrons per gram per second.<br>Every cm in height of the neutron generator is half a gram in weight.<br>Again, the resulting neutrons’ energy (between 0 and 20 MeV) and velocity components in the x, y and z dimensions is random.<br>The size and configuration of the reactor core (e.g., the type of each channel) is provided by the user via a configuration script.<br>Reactor fuel can be a mixture of U235, U238, Pu239 and the configuration script provides the percentage of these in fuel assemblies.<br>Only U235 and Pu239 will fission, U238 does not.<br>From these percentages the code calculates the number of atoms in each fuel pellet for each chemical, with other elements that are fission byproducts (Barium, Krypton, Xenon, Strontium and Zirconium) set to zero initially.<br>The moderator can be one of water, heavy water (deuterium) or graphite. Each has different neutron slowing and absorption properties. The weight of the moderator in each channel is provided in grams. o<br>For instance, water is more likely to slow neutrons but also much more likely to absorb them.<br>We want the moderator to slow down the neutrons to increase the probability of fission, but we do not want it to absorb neutrons.<br>The heavier the moderator then the more of it is present, this will raise the probability of neutron slowing and moderator absorption.<br>The percentage of how far each control rod has been inserted into the reactor core can be provided, and if this is omitted then it is assumed a zero value (i.e. the control rod is fully out of the reactor).<br>Due to limitations of the simulation (runtime and memory), the engineers have set a maximum number of neutrons that can be active at any one time.<br>This artificial limit impacts the ability for the simulation to undertake fusion, and-so they have also introduced an artificial absorption probability multiplier, which increases the probability that an individual neutron is absorbed by the fuel by a specific multiplication factor.<br>Ideally, the parallelisation of their code will mean that they can remove or significantly increase the maximum neutrons configuration limitation.<br>Periodically the state of the reactor should be appended to a file.<br>This should contain, the simulation time, amount of energy released via fission and for each fuel assembly the number of atoms of Uranium (235, 236 and 238), Plutonium (239 and 240), Barium, Krypton, Xenon (134 and 140), Strontium and Zirconium present.<br>The frequency of this reactor state storage is configurable by the user.<br>There should be frequent summaries of simulation progress printed to stdio<br>Which includes the current simulation time, the number of active neutrons, the number of fissions so far and total amount of energy released through fission.<br>The simulation will terminate when a predetermined number of timesteps is reached.<br>A short report is printed to stdio which reports the total number of fissions that have completed and associated energy release, along with the simulation code’s runtime.<br>An excellent solution<br>To obtain marks beyond around 65% and into the distinction (70%+) level then you will need to do at least one of the following activities:</p><p>A framework that splits mechanism from policy, where the mechanism of your geometric or task-based decomposition is provided in a generic, reusable manner so that other people could leverage it. Your problem specific code should call into the framework and utilise the framework to undertake all the parallelism. Problem specific code should be entirely abstracted from the mechanism of parallelisation, and you should make clear in your report the design of your framework, where the split between mechanism and policy lies, and how users would use your framework.<br>Provide a mixed OpenMP and MPI implementation which uses OpenMP across cores in a NUMA region and/or node, and MPI between these processes. You will need to ensure that MPI is initialised in thread mode (init_thread) and ensure that the threading mode you are using is supported by your MPI library (using query_thread). More information about OpenMP and MPI interoperability can be found at <a href="https://github.com/EPCCed/archer2-AMPP-2022-06-29/blob/master/slides/L06MPIandOpenMP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/EPCCed/archer2-AMPP-2022-06-29/blob/master/slides/L06MPIandOpenMP.pdf</a> with the Cirrus and ARCHER2 websites explaining how to submit jobs with a mixture of processes and threads. Your report should explain how you have mixed OpenMP and MPI and provide some performance comparison against an MPI only approach to highlight whether this benefits the simulation code of not.<br>Doing only one of these well is sufficient for distinction level marks, and you will receive higher marks if you do both. I am more forgiving of a limited implementation if you do both however, so if you provide a framework and hybrid parallelisation which on their own are fairly limited and would score lower than a distinction, because you have done both then together this could take you above the distinction (70%) mark level.</p><p>Having Difficulty?<br>If you are struggling to get all the aspects running in parallel, then you may wish to limit your parallelisation to a simpler subset of the functionality. For example, you could modify the serial code so that neutrons are static throughout the simulation and not dynamically created or destroyed. If this is the case, then you should state clearly in your report which simplifications you have made. A working code for a simplified model could gain as good a mark or better than a broken code attempting the full model.</p><p>A code that does not quite work might be good enough to pass as long as the ideas are correct, and the code is accompanied by a good quality report. If a non-working code is submitted, the report should explain the parts that do work, should describe the symptoms of why the program is not working and the steps taken to try and fix the problems.</p><p>If all else fails, use the report to describe how you would have parallelised the code given more time. Describe the code that you have submitted.</p>]]></content>

You will be provided sample inputs and outputs (see below). Please understand that the goal of the samples is only to check that you can correctly parse the problem definitions and generate a correctly formatted output that contains a valid, but not necessarily good (or the only possible) move. In most situations, several moves will be possible, so your move may differ from our example and still be perfectly valid. You should not assume that if your program works on the samples, it is a correctly implemented game-playing agent. It is your task to make sure that your program will work correctly on any valid input. You are encouraged to try your own test cases or have your program play against itself to check how your program would behave in some complex situations. Since each request submission is checked by a set of programs, your output should match the specified format exactly. Failure to do so will most certainly cost some points. The output format is simple and examples are provided. You should upload and test your code on vocareum.com, and you will submit it there. You may use any of the programming languages and versions thereof provided by vocareum.com.</p><h3 id="Grading"><a href="#Grading" class="headerlink" title="Grading"></a>Grading</h3><p>Your code will be tested as follows: Your program should not require any command-line argument. It should read a text file called “input.txt” in the current directory that contains the current state of the game. It should write a file “output.txt” with your chosen move to the same current directory. Format for input.txt and output.txt is specified below. End-of-line character is LF (since vocareum is a Unix system and follows the Unix convention).</p><p>Note that if your code does not compile, or somehow fails to load and parse input.txt, or writes an incorrectly formatted output.txt, or no output.txt at all, or OuTpUt.TxT, you will get zero points. Anything you write to stdout or stderr will be ignored and is ok to leave in the code you submit (but it will likely slow you down). Please test your program with the provided sample files to avoid any problem.</p><h3 id="Project-description"><a href="#Project-description" class="headerlink" title="Project description"></a>Project description</h3><p>In this project, we will implement agent that plays the game of Pente, the two-player version of the abstract strategy board game. It is in the m,n,k-game family from which tic-tac-toe (3,3,3) and Connect Four also come from, where the players are trying to connect k pieces on the board before the other player does. Pente stands out from these games because it includes a piece capture mechanic, where the player can sandwich a pair of their opponent’s pieces and capture them. It is played on a 19x19 board, where pieces are placed on the intersection of the lines (like the game Go). White always opens the game (like in Chess). The players take turns putting pieces on the board until:<br>1) A player connects 5 of their pieces in a horizontal, vertical or a diagonal line, OR<br>2) A player makes 5 total captures (equals to 10 pieces of their opponent’s since pieces can only be captured in pairs).</p><p>The custodial capture mechanic, where a player flanks the opponent’s pieces with their own to capture them, only applies to pairs of the opponent’s pieces. Therefore, if the current board formation is XOO_ and player X plays their piece as XOOX, the O pieces are captured and the board becomes X_ <em>X. Note again that this only works for pairs of pieces, therefore X cannot capture their opponent’s pieces from a board like XOOO</em> or XO_.</p><p>Captures only happen when a capturing piece is placed. Therefore, if the board is XO_X and O places a piece in the free intersection, the board formation becomes XOOX and no capture happens by X.</p><p>More details on the game can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente</a> and we will also go over the gameplay for you below (be careful, Wikipedia images show a 13x13 board). If you would like to try the game of Pente to understand the general gameplay, you can utilize the “Play the AI” option without having to log in at <a href="https://pente.org/join.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pente.org/join.jsp</a>. Note that these resources are just for you to familiarize yourself with the game, you should strictly follow the rules we outline below while coding your game-playing agent (there are several variants of the game).</p><p>The original Pente game is known to favor the first player. This is called the First Player<br>Advantage (FPA) and there has been many suggestions to level the playing field for the second player. A discussion about this can be found in: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente#First_Player_Advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente#First_Player_Advantage</a></p><p>We will be employing certain rules that have been used in the past in Pente tournaments to make this game fairer for the second player. More details of these can be found below. These will also help us determine how winners are determined in student competitions.</p><h4 id="Setup-of-the-game"><a href="#Setup-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Setup of the game"></a>Setup of the game</h4><p>The setup of the game is as follows:</p><p>Each player plays as white or black.<br>The board consists of an 19x19 grid of squares.<br>Before the game starts, the board is empty.<br>White always opens the game.<br>First piece (White) must be placed in the middle of the board.<br>The second move of White (first player) cannot be more than 3 intersections away from their first piece (center). This is one of the rules that alleviates the first player advantage (FPA).<br>Pieces can be placed in any empty intersection (apart from the first player restrictions explained above).<br>Placed pieces cannot be removed from the board unless they are captured.<br>Here’s the visualization of an empty board and an example start, just after White has placed their second piece following the anti-FPA restriction.</p><p>As can be seen in the right image above, White has placed their 2nd piece 3 intersections away which is the maximum possible amount for their second move. In following turns, pieces can be placed in any empty intersection, but your agent should be able to figure out which is best.</p><h4 id="Play-sequence"><a href="#Play-sequence" class="headerlink" title="Play sequence"></a>Play sequence</h4><p>We first describe the typical play for humans. We will then describe some minor modifications for how we will play this game with artificial agents.</p><p>Create the initial board setup according to the above description.<br>Players randomly determine who will play White/Black. White will play first.<br>During their turn, each player places a single piece of one’s own color on the board:<br>Once placed, the pieces cannot be removed from their intersection unless they are captured by the opponent.<br>A simple move:<br>Can be played on any empty intersection (including border intersections).<br>If playing White, player must place their 1st piece in the center of the board and their 2nd piece no more than 3 intersections away from the 1st piece.<br>A capture move:<br>Is played next to a pair of the opponent’s pieces such that they are flanked (sandwiched) by one of the player’s pieces. The opponent’s pieces are captured by the player when this happens. A sample capture can be seen below:<br>The capture can be made for pieces that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally oriented.<br>When capture happens, the pair of pieces belonging to the opponent are removed from the board and added to the player’s capture pile.<br>One capture move can be used to capture one or more pairs of pieces from the opponent. Sample of this can be seen below:<br>Note that captures only happen when both of the opponent’s pieces are on the board when a capturing move is made. Therefore, if the board state is XO_X and O moves to make it XOOX, the pair of O pieces are not captured by X. An example for this is below.<br>If the current play results in a board where the active player has 5+ connected pieces on the board OR has 5 pairs (or 10 pieces) total captured from their opponent, the game ends. Otherwise, play proceeds to the other player.<br>If above conditions are not met, and there is no more room left on the board to play a piece, the game ends in a draw.</p><h3 id="Playing-with-agents"><a href="#Playing-with-agents" class="headerlink" title="Playing with agents"></a>Playing with agents</h3><p>In this request, your agent will play against another agent, either implemented by the TAs, or by another student in the class.</p><p>For grading, your agent will play against two different agents implemented by the TAs. 10 full games will be against a random agent (this should be easy for your agent to beat), and another 10 full games will be against a simple minimax agent with no alpha-beta pruning. There will be a limited total amount of play time available to your agent for the whole game (e.g., 100 seconds), so you should think about how to best use it throughout the game. This total amount of time will vary from game to game. Your agent must play correctly (no illegal moves, etc.) and beat the reference agents to receive 5 points per game. Your agent will be given the first move on 12 of the 20 games. In case of a draw, the agent with more remaining play time wins. Note that, while playing games, you should think about how to divide your remaining play time across possibly many moves throughout the game.</p><p>In addition to grading, we will run a competition where your agent plays against agents created by the other students in the class. This will not affect your grade, but it would look very good on your Resume if you finish in the top 10, or are the grand winner!</p><h3 id="Agent-vs-agent-games"><a href="#Agent-vs-agent-games" class="headerlink" title="Agent vs agent games"></a>Agent vs agent games</h3><p>Playing against another agent will be organized as follows (both when your agent plays against the reference minimax agent, or against another student’s agent):</p><p>A master game playing engine will be implemented by the grading team. This engine will:</p><p>Create the initial board setup according to the above description.<br>Assign a player color (Black or White) to your agent. The player who gets assigned White will have the first move.<br>Then, in sequence, until the game is over:<br>The master game playing engine will create an input.txt file which contains the current board configuration, which color your agent should play, and how much total play time your agent has left. This file will also contain number of pieces captured by each agent until that point in the game. More details on the exact format of input.txt are given below.<br>We will then run your agent. Your agent should read input.txt in the current directory, decide on a move, and create an output.txt file that describes the move (details below). Your time will be measured (total CPU time). If your agent does not return before your time is over, it will be killed and it loses the game.<br>Your remaining playing time will be updated by subtracting the time taken by your agent on this move. If time left reaches zero or negative, your agent loses the game.<br>The validity of your move will be checked. If the format of output.txt is incorrect or your move is invalid according to the rules of the game, your agent loses the game. (Reminder: Any empty spot on the board is a valid move, except for the rules for the first two moves of the white player.)<br>Your move will be executed by the master game playing engine. This will update the game board to a new configuration.<br>The master game playing engine will check for a game-over condition. If one occurs, the winning agent or a draw will be declared accordingly.<br>The master game playing engine will then present the updated board to the opposing agent and let that agent make one move (with the same rules as just described for your agent; the only difference is that the opponent plays the other color and has its own time counter).<br>Game continues until an end condition is reached.<br>Input and output file formats<br>Input: The file input.txt in the current directory of your program will be formatted as follows:<br>First line: A string BLACK or WHITE indicating which color you play. White will always start the game.<br>Second line: A strictly positive floating point number indicating the amount of play time remaining for your agent (in seconds).<br>Third line: Two non-negative 32-bit integers separated by a comma indicating the number of pieces captured by White and Black players consecutively. Caution, it will always be ordered as first captured by White, then by Black, irrespective of what color is given in the first line.<br>Next 19 lines: Description of the game board, with 19 lines of 19 symbols each:</p><p>w for a cell occupied by a white piece<br>b for a cell occupied by a black piece<br>. (a dot) for an empty intersection<br>For example:</p><p>BLACK<br>100.0<br>0,0<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>………w………<br>……….b……..<br>………w.bw……<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>In this input.txt example, your agent should play a move as the Black agent and has 100.0 seconds. The board configuration is 5 turns into the game. There’s a capture condition for White, so your agent could likely choose to block that by putting their piece in the red highlighted position on the board.</p><p>Output: The format we will use for describing the square positions is borrowed from the notations from Pente.org, where every column is described by a letter and every row is described by a number. The position for a given square is given as the concatenation of these. Here’s a useful visualization on how we identify each intersection for the 19x19 Pente board:</p><p>Using the above image as reference, in the input.txt sample given above, White has pieces on 10K, 10N and 12K, while Black has pieces on 11L and 10M. Using this type of notation for the cells on our gameboard, the file output.txt which your program creates in the current directory should be formatted as follows:</p><p>1 line: PIECE_POS which describes your move with an integer (1-19) and an uppercase letter (A-T) concatenated.</p><p>For example, for the red highlighted move in the input sample, output.txt may contain:<br>9N</p><p>The resulting board would look like this, given the above input.txt (the master game playing engine will compute this and it is not part of output.txt):</p><p>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>………w………<br>……….b……..<br>………w.bw……<br>…………b……<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>……………….<br>Notes and hints<br>Please name your program “request.xxx” where ‘xxx’ is the extension for the programming language you choose (“py” for python, “cpp” for C++11, and “java” for Java).<br>The board you will be given as input will always be valid and will have w and b letters, as well as . (standing for empty cells).<br>Likely (but not guaranteed), total play time will be 5 minutes (300.0 seconds) when playing against another agent.<br>Play time used on each move is the total combined CPU time as measured by the Unix time command. This command measures pure computation time used by your agent, and discards time taken by the operating system, disk I/O, program loading, etc. Beware that it cumulates time spent in any threads spawned by your agent (so if you run 4 threads and use 400% CPU for 10 seconds, this will count as using 40 seconds of allocated time).<br>If your agent runs for more than its given play time (in input.txt), it will be killed and will lose the game.<br>You need to think and strategize how to best use your allocated time. In particular, you need to decide on how deep to carry your search, on each move. In some cases, your agent might be given only a very short amount of time (e.g., 5.2 seconds, or even 0.01 seconds), for example towards the end of a game. Your agent should be prepared for that and return a quick decision to avoid losing by running over time. The amount of play time that will be given in input.txt will always be ]0, but it could be very small if you are close to running out of time.<br>To help you with figuring out the speed of the computer that your agent runs on, you are allowed to also provide a second program called calibrate.xxx (same extension conventions as for request.xxx). This is optional. If one is present, we will run your calibrate program once (and only once) before we run your agent for grading or against another agent. You can use calibrate to, e.g., measure how long it takes to expand some fixed number of search nodes, or to benchmark the CPU speed in any other way you like.<br>You can then save this into a single file called calibration.txt in the current directory. When your agent runs during grading or during a game, it could then read calibration.txt in addition to reading input.txt, and use the data from calibration.txt to strategize about search depth or other factors. Please aim for no more than 5 minutes to run your calibrate program. A few seconds (e.g., expand 10,000 nodes) is usually enough to get a good estimate of the CPU speed.<br>You need to think hard about how to design your eval function (which gives a value to a board when it is not game over yet).<br>You are allowed to maintain persistent data across moves during a game, by writing such data to a single file called playdata.txt in the current directory. Before a new game starts, the master game playing engine will delete any playdata.txt file. So, on your first move, this file will not exist, and you should be prepared for that. Then, you can write some data to that file at the end of a move and read that file back at the beginning of the next move.<br>As mentioned, there is some first player advantage in this game for two agents with perfect play (even with our rules for the first two White moves). Therefore, when playing against a reference agent, we will give your agent the first move for 6 of the 10 games. In the competition, we will play two agents against each other for an even number of games giving each the first player for half of the games, and advance both agents to the next round of the competition if they both win or draw on half of the games. If an agent loses more than half of the games, it will be eliminated and only the other agent will move to the next round of the competition. We may end up with several equivalent winners of the competition.<br>The random agent created by the TAs will likely not be uniformly random over the whole board, but may choose randomly between several candidate locations, for example all locations adjacent to pieces already on the board. The minimax TA agent will not use alpha-beta and will likely be capped at a low lookahead depth; but it will do adaptive depth choice on every move to avoid running out of time (e.g., use depth 3 when ]50s remains, depth 1 when [ 3s, otherwise depth 2).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>Bob has a crush on one of his classmates in his programming class, so he wants to figure out if they are a good match. Because he took a few programming lessons, he thought he could solve this question by developing a compatibility calculator. A compatibility calculator calculates how compatible two people are based on different features, but Bob only knows his crush’s name and birthday, so that’s what he’s using.</p><p>Help Bob complete a program to calculate the love compatibility between two people based on their names and birthdays. Here is an example of how the calculator should work:<br><figure class="highlight gams"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">* Give me your first and last name:</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; Bob Boba</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">* Give me your birthdate in the format YYYY/MM/DD:</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; <span class="number">2004</span>/<span class="number">12</span>/<span class="number">21</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">* Give me your crush's first and last name:</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; Bobbette Bibi</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">* Give me your crush's birthdate in the format YYYY/MM/DD:</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; <span class="number">2004</span>/<span class="number">02</span>/<span class="number">04</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">* You are 74.0% compatible in love!</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><h3 id="Goals-of-this-request"><a href="#Goals-of-this-request" class="headerlink" title="Goals of this request"></a>Goals of this request</h3><p>While developing your A2 program, you will:</p><p>continue to apply the Function Design Recipe<br>use the debugger to find out why your code isn’t working<br>read and understand function docstrings<br>practice writing helper functions<br>work with for and while loops<br>implement conditional statements<br>manipulate strings using slicing and string methods<br>build nested lists from raw data practice list mutation<br>Bob says, “Zounds, that’s a lot! What the heck are you teaching them?”</p><h3 id="Starter-Code"><a href="#Starter-Code" class="headerlink" title="Starter Code"></a>Starter Code</h3><p>For this request, we are giving you some files to help you get started. Please download the request 2 Files and extract the zip archive, as you did with A1.</p><p>Here are the files for A2:</p><p>compatibility_calculator.py is the file in which you will write your solution. It is the only file you will submit. Your job is to design and implement all the required functions. is the file containing the compatibility data for you to run the program. You won’t submit this file.<br>compatibility_data.py<br>We will test whether your code still works if we change the values defined in this file.<br>Bob says that you should do that too: after you get your program working, he suggests commenting out the current values in this file (so you can recover them later) and then try different values to see if the code still works.<br>a2_checker.py, checker_generic.py, and a2_pythonta.json<br>Together, these are the checker program that you should use to check your code. You will not modify these files.</p><h3 id="Running-the-checker"><a href="#Running-the-checker" class="headerlink" title="Running the checker"></a>Running the checker</h3><p>Bob recommends that you run a2_checker.py every time you complete a function so you don’t have to fix it all at the end.</p><p>If you run it on the starter code, you’ll see a bunch of notices like this:<br><figure class="highlight groovy"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">FAILED a2_checker.<span class="string">py:</span>:<span class="string">TestChecker:</span>:test_count_common_occurrences - <span class="string">AssertionError:</span> count_comm on_occurrences should <span class="keyword">return</span> a <span class="keyword">int</span>, but returned None.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>As you update each function, that error message will disappear.</p><h3 id="Problem-description"><a href="#Problem-description" class="headerlink" title="Problem description"></a>Problem description</h3><p>The compatibility calculator consists of three sub-calculators:</p><p>Name compatibility calculator<br>Birthday compatibility calculator<br>Astrological compatibility calculator<br>Each of these sub-calculators generate a compatibility score, and the total compatibility score of the calculator is their average value.</p><p>We have provided all function headers and the docstrings in compatibility_calculator.py. Read them carefully and make sure you understand each function’s purpose before implementing it.</p><h3 id="Functions-you-need-to-implement"><a href="#Functions-you-need-to-implement" class="headerlink" title="Functions you need to implement"></a>Functions you need to implement</h3><p>Task 1: Name compatibility calculator<br>In this task, you will implement the name compatibility calculator. You need to complete the following functions:</p><p>count_common_occurrences(str, str) -&gt; int - The parameters represent names, like ‘Washburn and ‘the fabulous Q’, and when you call this function it will return the number of letters from the first one that appear in the second one, ignoring case. Spaces, punctuation, Marchmutt’ and digits are of course not alphabetic.<br>See the docstring for more details, including examples.<br>Hint: use a string method that tell you whether a character is alphabetic and another string method that gives you a lowercase or uppercase version of a string.<br>get_name_compatibility(str, str) -&gt; int - This function returns the name compatibility between two names in the input. According to Bob’s rules, this should be calculated by checking how many letters in the first person’s name occur in the second person’s name, and adding this to how many letters in the second one occur in the first one (all ignoring case), then dividing this sum by the total number of alphabetic characters in the two names combined, and multiplying this by 100.<br>See the docstring for more details.<br>Hint: use the count_common_occurrences function as a helper.<br>Task 2: Birthday compatibility calculator<br>In this task, you will implement the birthday compatibility calculator.</p><p>To calculate the compatibility between two birthdays, you need to get their numerological numbers and decide whether they are compatible or not.</p><p>Task 2.1: Dealing with the birthdates<br>For your first task, you will complete three helper functions for dealing with the date input:</p><p>extract_year(str) -&gt; int<br>extract_month(str) -&gt; int<br>extract_day(str) -&gt; int<br>The description and examples have been provided for function extract_year. Follow the TODO instructions in these functions to complete them.<br>Task 2.2: Calculate the numerological number of a birthday<br>For this task, Bob completed function get_bday_numerology_num, but it relies on a helper function, get_numerological_root, which he never got around to figuring out. So you’re going to have to do it:</p><p>get_numerological_root(int) -&gt; int - This function should return the numerological root number of the input. The root number is found by adding the digits in the parameter value together until you are left with either a single digit or one of the two Special Numbers: 11 or 22.<br>For example, the numerological root number of 1998 is 9. This is because 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 27. Since 27 has two digits and is not a Special Number, we repeat the summing process: 2 + 7 = 9. 9 has one digit, so it is the numerological root number of 1998.<br>See the docstring for more details.<br>Hint: You can turn the parameter value into a string to deal with it, or you can use operators % and //. The expression n % 10 gives you the last digit in a number n , and n // 10 removes the last digit in n.<br>Task 2.3: Calculate the compatibility between two numerological numbers<br>Go look at the NUM_COMPATIBILITY_DATA list in compatibility_data.py. Do this now, before reading the rest of the handout. The list shows whether two numbers are “compatible”, according to Bob.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Objective"><a href="#Objective" class="headerlink" title="Objective"></a>Objective</h3><p>The objective of project is to familiarize you with UNIX socket programming. It is an individual request and no collaborations are allowed. If you have any doubts/questions email the TA your questions, come by TA’s office hours, or ask during the weekly discussion session. You can ask TAs any question about the content of the project, but TAs have the right to reject your request for debugging.</p><p>Problem Statement<br>In this part of the project, you will implement client-server socket programming using TCP. In a Student Performance Analysis system of a university, a client (student) would like to ask the Main server which Backend server that a department is associated with. A client sends a department name to the Main server and the Main server will search in its database and reply to the client with a Backend server ID.</p><p>The detailed operations to be performed by all the parties are described with the help of Figure 1. There are in total 3 communication endpoints, which are run in 3 individual terminal windows:</p><p>Client 1 and Client 2: represent two different users, send queries to main server<br>Main server: store information, search, send responses to clients<br>You are highly encouraged to use Beej’s Guide to Network Programming to complete this request. You can use code from Beej’s Guide as a starting point (remember to mention any code you take directly from other sources like Beej’s Guide in the README and your comments).</p><p>The full process can be roughly divided into three phases, and their communication and computation steps are as follows:</p><p>Bootup<br>[Computation]: Main server read the file list.txt and store the information.<br>[Communication]: Main server process wait for client processes to connect.<br>[Computation]: Two clients run and ask the user to input a department name.<br>Query<br>[Communication]: Each client then establishes a TCP connection to the Main server and sends their queries (the department name) to the Main server.<br>A client can terminate itself only after it receives a reply from the server (in the Reply phase).<br>Main server may be connected to both clients at the same time.<br>[Computation]: Once the Main server receives the queries, it decodes the queries and searches in the list with the received department name, obtaining the corresponding Backend server ID.<br>Reply<br>[Communication]: Main server prepares a reply message and sends the result to the appropriate client.<br>[Communication]: Clients receive the reply message from Main server and display it. Clients should keep active for further inputted queries, until the program is manually killed (Ctrl-C).<br>The format of list.txt is as follows.</p><p><backend server id></backend></p><p><department name>,<department name>,<department name></department></department></department></p><p><backend server id></backend></p><p><department name>,<department name><br>…<br>Example list.txt:</department></department></p><p>1<br>ECE,CS,Physics<br>2<br>Art,Cinema<br>3<br>Accounting,Business<br>…<br>Assumptions on the list.txt file:</p><p>Department names are letters. The length of a department name can vary from 1 letter to at most 20 letters. It may contain both capital and lowercase letters but does not contain any white spaces.<br>Backend server IDs are non-negative integer numbers.<br>There are at most 10 Backend server IDs in total.<br>There is no additional empty line(s) at the beginning or the end of the file. That is, the whole list.txt do not contain any empty lines.<br>For simplicity, there is no overlap of department names among different Backend servers.<br>For a given Backend server, there may be repeated department names.<br>list.txt will not be empty.<br>A Backend server will store at least one department names, and at most 100 department names.<br>An example list.txt is provided for you as a reference. Other list.txt will be used for grading, so you are advised to prepare your own files for testing purposes.</p><p>Source Code Files<br>Your implementation should include the source code files described below:</p><p>servermain: You must name your code file: servermain.c or servermain.cc or servermain.cpp (all small letters). Also, you must name the corresponding header file (if you have one; it is not mandatory) servermain.h (all small letters).<br>client: The name for this piece of code must be client.c or client.cc or client.cpp (all small letters) and the header file (if you have one; it is not mandatory) must be called client.h (all small letters). There should be only one client file!!!<br>Note: Your compilation should generate separate executable files for each of the components listed above.</p><p>Detailed Explanation<br>Phase 1 – Bootup<br>Main server program first boots up in this phase.</p><p>./servermain<br>While booting up, the servers must display a boot up message on the terminal. The format of the boot up message for Main server is given in the on-screen message table at the end of the document. As the boot up message indicates, Main server must listen on the appropriate port for incoming packets/connections.</p><p>As described in the previous section, the main server needs to read the text file and store the information. There are many ways to store the information, such as dictionary, array, vector, etc. You need to decide which format to use based on the requirement of the problem. You can use any format if it can give you correct results.</p><p>Once the main server programs have booted up, two client programs run. Each client displays a boot up message as indicated in the onscreen messages table. Note that the client code takes no input argument from the command line. The format for running the client code is:</p><p>./client<br>After running it, it should display messages to ask the user to enter a query department name (e.g., implement using std::cin):</p><p>./client<br>Client is up and running.<br>Enter Department Name:<br>For example, if the client 1 is booted up and asks for Backend server ID for department ECE, then the terminal displays like this:</p><p>./client<br>Client is up and running.<br>Enter Department Name: ECE<br>Main server has its unique port number specified in “PORT NUMBER ALLOCATION” section with the source and destination IP address as localhost/127.0.0.1. Clients use dynamic ports.</p><p>Clients and Main server are required to print out on-screen messages after executing each action as described in the “ON SCREEN MESSAGES” section. These messages will help with grading if the process did not execute successfully. Missing some of the on-screen messages might result in misinterpretation that your process failed to complete. Please follow the exact format when printing the on-screen messages.</p><p>Phase 2 – Query<br>After booting up, Clients establish TCP connections with Main server. After successfully establishing the connection, Clients send the input department name to Main server. Once this is sent, Clients should print a message in a specific format. Repeat the same steps for Client 2.</p><p>Main server then receives requests from two Clients. If the department name is not found, the Main server will print out a message (see the “On Screen Messages” section) and return to standby.</p><p>For a server to receive requests from several clients at the same time, the function fork() should be used for the creation of a new process. fork() function is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process).</p><p>For a TCP server, when an application is listening for stream-oriented connections from other hosts, it is notified of such events and must initialize the connection using accept(). After the connection with the client is successfully established, the accept() function returns a non-zero descriptor for a socket called the child socket. The server can then fork off a process using fork() function to handle connection on the new socket and go back to wait on the original socket. Note that the socket that was originally created, that is the parent socket, is going to be used only to listen to the client requests, and it is not going to be used for computation or communication between client and Main server. Child sockets that are created for a parent socket have the identical well-known port number and IP address at the server side, but each child socket is created for a specific client. Through using the child socket with the help of fork(), the server can handle the two clients without closing any one of the connections.</p><p>Once the Main server receives the queries, it decodes the queries and searches in the list with the received department name, finding the corresponding backend server ID.</p><p>Phase 3 – Reply<br>At the end of Phase 2, the Main server should have the result ready. The result is the Backend server ID that the department is associated with. The result should be sent back to the corresponding client using TCP. The client will print out the backend server ID and then print out the messages for a new request as follows:</p><p>…<br>Department ECE is associated with backend server 1.<br>—–Start a new query—-Enter Department Name:<br>See the ON SCREEN MESSAGES table for an example output table.</p><p>Port Number Allocation<br>The ports to be used by the client and the servers are specified in the following table:</p><p>Process    Dynamic Ports    Static Ports<br>Main Server        TCP(with client): 33xxx<br>Client 1    TCP<br>Client 2    TCP<br>NOTE: xxx is the last 3 digits of your USC ID. For example, if the last 3 digits of your USC ID are “319”, you should use the port: 33319 for the Main Server, etc. Port number of all processes print port number of their own.</p><p>Assumptions<br>You must start the processes in this order: Main-server, Client 1, and Client 2.<br>list.txt is created before your program starts.<br>If you need to have more code files than the ones that are mentioned here, please use meaningful names and all small letters and mention them all in your README file.<br>You can use code snippets from Beej’s guide to network programming in your project. However, you need to mark the copied part in your code and mention in README.<br>When you run your code, if you get the message “port already in use” or “address already in use”, please first check to see if you have a zombie process (see following). If you do not have such zombie processes or if you still get this message after terminating all zombie processes, try changing the static TCP port number corresponding to this error message (all port numbers below 1024 are reserved and must not be used). If you must change the port number, please do mention it in your README file and provide reasons for it.<br>You may create zombie processes while testing your codes, please make sure you kill them every time you want to run your code. To see a list of all zombie processes, try this command:<br>ps -aux | grep developer<br>Identify the zombie processes and their process number and kill them by typing at the command-line:</p><p>kill -9 <process number><br>Requirements<br>Do not hardcode the TCP port numbers that are to be obtained dynamically. Refer to Table 1 to see which ports are statically defined and which ones are dynamically assigned. Use getsockname() function to retrieve the locally bound port number wherever ports are assigned dynamically as shown below.<br>The host name must be hard coded as localhost (127.0.0.1) in all codes.<br>Your client should keep running and ask to enter a new request after displaying the previous result, until the TAs manually terminate it by Ctrl+C. The backend servers and the Main server should keep running and be waiting for another request until the TAs terminate them by Ctrl+C. If they terminate before that, you will lose some points for it.<br>All the naming conventions and the on-screen messages must conform to the previously mentioned rules.<br>You are not allowed to pass any parameter or value or string or character as a commandline argument.<br>All the on-screen messages must conform exactly to the project description. You should not add anymore on-screen messages. If you need to do so for the debugging purposes, you must comment out all the extra messages before you submit your project.<br>Using fork() to create a child process when a new TCP connection is accepted is mandatory and everyone should support it. This is useful when different clients are trying to connect to the same server simultaneously.<br>Please do remember to close the socket and tear down the connection once you are done using that socket.<br>Programming Platform and Environment<br>All your submitted code MUST work well on the provided virtual machine Ubuntu.<br>All submissions will only be graded on the provided Ubuntu. TA won’t make any updates or changes to the virtual machine. It’s your responsibility to make sure your code works well on the provided Ubuntu. “It works well on my machine” is not an excuse and we don’t care.<br>Your submission MUST have a Makefile. Please follow the requirements in the following “Submission Rules” section.<br>Programming Languages and Compilers<br>You must use only C/C++ on UNIX as well as UNIX Socket programming commands and functions. Here are the pointers for Beej’s Guide to C Programming and Network Programming (socket programming): <a href="http://www.beej.us/guide/bgnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.beej.us/guide/bgnet/</a> (If you are new to socket programming please do study this tutorial carefully as soon as possible and before starting the project) <a href="http://www.beej.us/guide/bgc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.beej.us/guide/bgc/</a></process></p><p>You can use a Unix text editor like emacs or gedit to type your code and then use compilers such as g++ (for C++) and gcc (for C) that are already installed on Ubuntu to compile your code. You must use the following commands and switches to compile yourfile.c or yourfile.cpp. It will make an executable by the name of “yourfileoutput”.</p><p>gcc -o yourfileoutput yourfile.c<br>g++ -o yourfileoutput yourfile.cpp<br>Do NOT forget the mandatory naming conventions mentioned before!<br>Also, inside your code you may need to include these header files in addition to any other header file you used:</p><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11</p><p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;errno.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</p><p>#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;<br>Submission Rules<br>Along with your code files, include a README file and a Makefile. Submissions without README and Makefile will be subject to a serious penalty.</p><p>In the README file write:</p><p>Your Full Name as given in the class list.<br>Your Student ID.<br>Your platform (Ubuntu version).<br>What you have done in the request.<br>What your code files are and what each one of them does. (Please do not repeat the project description, just name your code files, and briefly mention what they do).<br>The format of all the messages exchanged.<br>Any idiosyncrasy of your project. It should say under what conditions the project fails, if any.<br>Reused Code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? If not, say so. If so, say what functions and where they’re from. (Also identify this with a comment in the source code.)<br>About the Makefile<br>Makefile Tutorial:<br><a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html</a></p><p>TA will first compile all codes using make all. TA will then open 3 different terminal windows. On one terminal, start Main Server using commands ./servermain. Remember that main server should always be on once started. On the other two terminals, start the client as ./client. TA will check the outputs for multiple queries. The terminals should display the messages specified above.</p><p>Please follow these rules to submit your request:</p><p>Compress all your files including the README file into a single “tar ball” and call it: ee450_yourUSCusername.tar.gz (all small letters) e.g. your filename may be ee450_nanantha.tar.gz. Please make sure that your name matches the one in the class list.<br>Do NOT include anything not required in your tar.gz file, for example data file list.txt. Do NOT use subfolders. Any compressed format other than .tar.gz will NOT be graded!<br>Upload “ee450_yourUSCusername.tar.gz” to Blackboard -&gt; requests. After the file is submitted, you must click on the “submit” button to actually submit it. If you do not click on “submit”, the file will not be submitted.<br>Blackboard will keep a history of all your submissions. If you make multiple submissions, we will grade your latest valid submission. Submission after the deadline is considered as invalid.<br>Please consider all kinds of possible technical issues and do expect a huge traffic on the Blackboard website very close to the deadline which may render your submission or even access to Blackboard unsuccessful.<br>Please DO NOT wait till the last 5 minutes to upload and submit because some technical issues might happen, and you will miss the deadline. And a kind suggestion, if you still get some bugs one hour before the deadline, please make a submission first to make sure you will get some points for your hard work!<br>After submitting, please confirm your submission by downloading and compiling it on your machine. If the outcome is not what you expected, try to resubmit, and confirm again. We will only grade what you submitted even though it’s corrupted.<br>You have sufficient time to work on this project and submit it in time hence there is absolutely zero tolerance for late submissions! Do NOT assume that there will be a late submission penalty or a grace period. If you submit your project late (no matter for what reason or excuse or even technical issues), you simply receive a zero for the project.<br>Grading Criteria<br>Notice: We will only grade what is already done by the program instead of what will be done. For example, the TCP connection is established, and data is sent to the Main Server. But the result is not received by the Main server (no on-screen message) because Main server got some errors. Then you will lose some points for phase 1 even though it might work well.</p><p>Your project grade will depend on the following:</p><p>Correct functionality, i.e. how well your programs fulfill the requirements of the request, especially the communications through TCP sockets.<br>Inline comments in your code. This is important as this will help in understanding what you have done.<br>Whether your programs work as you say they would in the README file.<br>Whether your programs print out the appropriate error messages and results.<br>If your submitted codes do not even compile, you will receive 10 out of 100 for the project.<br>If your submitted codes compile using make but when executed, produce runtime errors without performing any tasks of the project, you will receive 15 out of 100.<br>If you forget to include the README file or Makefile in the project tar-ball that you submitted, you will lose 15 points for each missing file (plus you need to send the file to the TA in order for your project to be graded.)<br>If you add subfolders or compress files in the wrong way, you will lose 2 points each.<br>If your data file path is not the same as the code files, you will lose 5 points.<br>Do not submit datafile (three .txt files) used for test, otherwise, you will lose 10 points.<br>If your code does not correctly assign the TCP port numbers (in any phase), you will lose 10 points each.<br>Detailed points requests for each functionality will be posted after finishing grading.<br>The minimum grade for an on-time submitted project is 10 out of 100, the submission includes a working Makefile and a README.<br>There are no points for the effort or the time you spend working on the project or reading the tutorial. If you spend plenty of time on this project and it doesn’t even compile, you will receive only 10 out of 100.<br>Your code will not be altered in any way for grading purposes and however it will be tested with different inputs. Your designated TA runs your project as is, according to the project description and your README file and then checks whether it works correctly or not. If your README is not consistent with the project description, we will follow the project description.<br>Final Words<br>Start on this project early. Hard deadline is strictly enforced. No grace periods. No grace days. No exceptions.<br>In view of what is a recurring complaint near the end of a project, we want to make it clear that the target platform on which the project is supposed to run is the provided Ubuntu (16.04/22.04). It is strongly recommended that students develop their code on this virtual machine. In case students wish to develop their programs on their personal machines, possibly running other operating systems, they are expected to deal with technical and incompatibility issues (on their own) to ensure that the final project compiles and runs on the requested virtual machine. If you do development on your own machine, please leave at least three days to make it work on Ubuntu. It might take much longer than you expect because of some incompatibility issues.<br>Check Blackboard (Discussion Board &amp; Announcement) regularly for additional requirements and latest updates about the project guidelines. Any project changes announced on Blackboard are final and overwrites the respective description mentioned in this document.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h3><p>This is a programming request. You will be provided sample inputs and outputs (see below). Please understand that the goal of the samples is to check that you can correctly parse the problem definitions and generate a correctly formatted output. The samples are very simple and it should not be assumed that if your program works on the samples it will work on all test cases. There will be more complex test cases and it is your task to make sure that your program will work correctly on any valid input. You are encouraged to try your own test cases to check how your program would behave in some complex special case that you might think of. Since each request is checked via an automated A.I. script, your output should match the specified format exactly. Failure to do so will most certainly cost some points. The output format is simple and examples are provided below. You should upload and test your code on vocareum.com, and you will also submit it there. You may use any of the programming languages provided by vocareum.com.</p><p>Grading<br>Your code will be tested as follows: Your program should not require any command-line argument. It should read a text file called “input.txt” in the current directory that contains a problem definition. It should write a file “output.txt” with your solution to the same current directory. Format for input.txt and output.txt is specified below. End-of-line character is LF (since vocareum is a Unix system and follows the Unix convention).</p><p>The grading A.I. script will, 50 times:</p><p>Create an input.txt file, delete any old output.txt file.<br>Run your code.<br>Check correctness of your program’s output.txt file.<br>If your outputs for all 50 test cases are correct, you get 100 points.<br>If one or more test case fails, you get 100 - 2xN points where N is the number of failed test cases.<br>Note that if your code does not compile, or somehow fails to load and parse input.txt, or writes an incorrectly formatted output.txt, or no output.txt at all, or OuTpUt.TxT, you will get zero points. Anything you write to stdout or stderr will be ignored and is ok to leave in the code you submit (but it will likely slow you down). Please test your program with the provided sample files to avoid any problem.</p><h3 id="Project-description"><a href="#Project-description" class="headerlink" title="Project description"></a>Project description</h3><p>In this project, we look at the problem of path planning in a different way just to give you the opportunity to deepen your understanding of search algorithms and modify search techniques to fit the criteria of a realistic problem. To give you a context for how search algorithms can be utilized, we invite you to a Ski Resort. However, this is not a ski resort for the faint of heart. In this resort, there are no carved-out slopes and skiers must plan their own path to the lodge at the bottom of the mountain. The terrain is treacherous and the success of reaching the lodge depends on the level of the skier. We are invited to develop an algorithm to find the optimal path to reach our destination (and to a cup of hot cocoa) based on a particular objective.</p><p>The input of our program includes a topographical map of the mountain resort, plus some information about where our skier starts their journey, the position of the lodge and some other quantities that control the quality of the solution. The mountain can be imagined as a surface in a 3-dimensional space, and a popular way to represent it is by using a mesh-grid. The E value assigned to each cell represents the elevation of that location or whether it contains a tree we need to navigate around. At each cell, the skier can move to one of 8 possible neighbor cells: North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West, and North-West. Actions are assumed to be deterministic and error-free (the skier will always end up at the intended neighbor cell).</p><p>The skier cannot go over trees that are high enough to not have been covered with snow, nor go up a slope unless they have enough speed or stamina. Therefore, the value E in each cell can advise us on whether we can take that route (in case of tree and hills) or how much stamina moving into that cell will cost the skier if they move into it.</p><h3 id="Search-for-the-optimal-paths"><a href="#Search-for-the-optimal-paths" class="headerlink" title="Search for the optimal paths"></a>Search for the optimal paths</h3><p>Our task is to lead the skier from their start position to the ski lodge, where they can celebrate a good ski day with a cup of hot chocolate. If we had a very advanced skier that can go across any land without a problem, usually the shortest geometrical path is defined as the optimal path; however, since our skiers might be at different levels (we will define this as stamina), our objective is to avoid high trees as well as very steep areas, unless we have gained some momentum first. Thus, we want to minimize the path from A to B under those constraints. Our goal is, roughly, finding the shortest path among the safe paths. What defines the safety of a path is whether there are trees we can’t cross and the elevation of the cells along that path.</p><h3 id="Problem-definition-details"><a href="#Problem-definition-details" class="headerlink" title="Problem definition details"></a>Problem definition details</h3><p>You will write a program that will take an input file that describes the land, the starting point, potential lodges we can relax in, and some other characteristics for our skier. For each lodge location, you should find the optimal (shortest) safe path from the starting point to that target lodge. A path is composed of a sequence of elementary moves. Each elementary move consists of moving the skier from their current position to one of its 8 neighbors. To find the solution you will use the following algorithms:</p><p>Breadth-first search (BFS)<br>Uniform-cost search (UCS)<br>A<em> search (A</em>).<br>Your algorithm should return an optimal path, that is, with shortest possible journey cost. Journey cost is further described below and is not equal to geometric path length. If an optimal path cannot be found, your algorithm should return “FAIL” as further described below.</p><h3 id="Terrain-map"><a href="#Terrain-map" class="headerlink" title="Terrain map"></a>Terrain map</h3><p>We assume a terrain map for the mountain is specified as follows:</p><p>A matrix with H rows (where H is a strictly positive integer) and W columns (W is also a strictly positive integer) will be given, with a value E (an integer number, to avoid rounding problems) specified in every cell of the WxH map. If E is a negative integer, this means there is a tree of height |E| in that cell. If E is a positive integer, the value represents the elevation of that cell. For example:<br>10 20 -30<br>12 13 40<br>is a map with W=3 columns and H=2 rows, and each cell contains an E value (in arbitrary units). By convention, we will use North (N), East (E), South (S), West (W) as shown above to describe motions from one cell to another. In the above example, elevation E in the North-West (NW) corner of the map is 10, and it is 40 in the South-East (SE) corner, which means our skier will spend more stamina to move into the SE corner than the NW corner.</p><p>Every skier will have a stamina value S that determines whether they can climb up certain elevations. A move from E = 20 to E = 40 is only allowed if a skier’s stamina is higher than or equal to 40 - 20 = 20. Important Note: Stamina remains as a constant value.</p><p>Notice that there is a tree of height 30 in the NE corner. If a cell contains a tree, there are a few factors that determine whether a move into that cell is allowed:</p><p>If your current E is higher than or equal to tree height |E|, you are allowed to move into the cell. In this case, we imagine the tree is covered with snow of height |E|. Therefore, if our tree is height 30 as above, it would be allowed to move into that cell from the cell with elevation 40, but not from others.<br>If your current E is lower than the tree height |E|, a move into that cell is not allowed from your current cell. Note that your stamina (or momentum) does not change whether a move like this is allowed.<br>To help us distinguish between your three algorithm implementations, you must follow the following conventions for computing operational path length:</p><p>Breadth-first search (BFS)<br>In BFS, each move from one cell to any of its 8 neighbors counts for a unit path cost of 1. You do not need to worry about the elevation levels or about the fact that moving diagonally (e.g., NorthEast) is actually a bit longer than moving along the North to South or East to West directions. However, you still need to make sure the move is allowed by checking how steep the move is (depends on the skier’s stamina) or whether a tree is involved. Therefore, any allowed move from one cell to an adjacent cell costs 1.</p><p>Uniform-cost search (UCS)<br>When running UCS, you should compute unit path costs in 2D. Assume that cells’ center coordinates projected to the 2D ground plane are spaced by a 2D distance of 10 North-South and East-West. That is, a North or South or East or West move from a cell to one of its 4-connected neighbors incurs a unit path cost of 10, while a diagonal move to a neighbor incurs a unit path cost of 14 as an approximation to 10 when running UCS. You still need to make sure the move is allowed, in the same way you did for BFS.</p><p>A<em> search (A</em>).<br>When running A*, you will have modified rules for allowed moves AND you should compute an approximate integer unit path cost for each move according to how the elevation of the terrain changes. We will explain these rules using elevations Ecurr (current cell elevation), Enext (potential next cell elevation), and Eprev (previous cell elevation), as well as stamina S (given as input) and momentum M (defined below).</p><p>Allowed moves for A<em>: For running A</em>, we modify whether a move is allowed by considering momentum (M), that is whether we gained some speed by going down in elevation in our most recent move. If we are currently at a cell with Ecurr, whether we are allowed to go into a cell Enext is determined by whether our momentum M going from Eprev to Ecurr can assist us.</p><p>That is, when we are going down from Eprev to Ecurr and then up from Ecurr to Enext, momentum M is &gt; 0 and will possibly assist us in reaching cells with higher Enext elevations. If the next move is going up in elevation (Enext &gt; Ecurr), a move will only be allowed if (Enext &lt;= Ecurr + S + M). For BFS/UCS, this rule was (Enext &lt;= Ecurr + S). M = 0 initially at the starting position. Note how in all cases other than going down from Eprev to Ecurr and then up from Ecurr to Enext, momentum M is 0 according to the above definition. Note that momentum does not accumulate across multiple moves. Only the latest Eprev to Ecurr are considered when computing M.</p><p>If a tree is involved, the rules to determine whether a move is allowed do not change from the BFS/UCS cases. If you are allowed to move into a cell with a tree, it acts as land with elevation |E| from then on.</p><p>Path cost for A<em>: You should also compute an approximate integer unit path cost for each move for A</em>, which is now approximately 3D. The cost of a move is computed by considering both the horizontal move distance as in the UCS case (unit cost of 10 when moving North to South or East to West, and unit cost of 14 when moving diagonally) and the change in elevation levels of the land. The cost C for the move is hence defined as follows:</p><p>C = (Horizontal Move Distance) + (Elevation Change Cost)<br>Thus, intuitively, the elevation change cost is how much we are going uphill, possibly minus how much momentum we have from going downhill on the previous move.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>If our previous cell was Eprev = 20 and our current cell is Ecurr = 8, we have M = 12. If our stamina is 30, we are allowed to go into a cell with Enext up to Ecurr + M + S = 8 + 12 + 30 = 50. Assume we choose a cell with Enext = 25. If we’re moving diagonally, our path cost becomes: 14 (Move Distance) + (25 - 8 - 12 = 5) (Elevation Change Cost) = 19.</p><p>If our previous cell was Eprev = 20 and our current cell is Ecurr = 25, we have M = 0. If our stamina is 15, we are allowed to go into, for example, a cell with Enext = 35 (since 35 - 25 [ 0 + 15). If we’re moving South, our path cost becomes: 10 (Move Distance) + (35 - 25) (Elevation Change Cost) = 20.</p><p>If our current cell is Ecurr = 40 and our next cell is Enext = 15, the move is allowed since we are going downhill. If we’re moving East, our path cost becomes: 10 (Move Distance) + (0) (Elevation Change Cost) = 10.</p><p>If our previous cell was Eprev = 12 and our current cell is Ecurr = -5, we have M = 7, since we treat tree cells as |E| elevation once we move into them. If our stamina is 5, we can go into, for example, a cell with Enext = 30 (since 30 - 12 [ 7 + 5). If we’re moving SW, our path cost becomes: 14 (Move Distance) + (30 - 5 - 7) (Elevation Change Cost) = 32.</p><p>Remember: In addition to computing the path cost, you also need to design an admissible heuristic for A* for this problem.</p><p>Input: The file input.txt in the current directory of your program will be formatted as follows:</p><p>First line: Instruction of which algorithm to use, as a string: BFS, UCS or A*<br>Second line: Two strictly positive 32-bit integers separated by one space character, for “W H” the number of columns (width) and rows (height), in cells, of the map.<br>Third line: Two positive 32-bit integers separated by one space character, for “X Y” the coordinates (in cells) of the starting position for our skier. 0 X W-1 and 0 Y H-1 (that is, we use 0-based indexing into the map; X increases when moving East and Y increases when moving South; (0,0) is the North West corner of the map). Starting point remains the same for each of the N lodge sites below and will never contain a tree.<br>Fourth line: Positive 32-bit integer number for the stamina S of the skier which determines how advanced our skier is. S will be used to compute allowed moves if we’re moving into a non-tree cell.<br>Fifth line: Strictly positive 32-bit integer N, the number of lodges on the mountain.<br>Next N lines: Two positive 32-bit integers separated by one space character, for “X Y” the coordinates (in cells) of each lodge site. 0 X W-1 and 0 Y H-1 (that is, we again use 0-based indexing into the map). These N target lodge sites are not related to each other, so you will run your search algorithm on each lodge site and write the result to the output as specified below. We will never give you a lodge site that is the same as the starting point. They will never contain a tree.<br>Next H lines: W 32-bit integer numbers separated by any numbers of spaces for the M values of each of the W cells in each row of the map. Each number can represent the following cases:<br>E &gt;= 0, snowy mountain slope with elevation E<br>E &lt; 0, tree of height |E| that might be covered with snow depending on the elevation we approach it from<br>For example:</p><p>A*<br>8 6<br>4 4<br>5<br>2<br>2 1<br>6 3<br>-10 40 34 21 42 37 18   7<br>-20 10  5 27 -6  5  2   0<br>-30  8 17 -3 -4 -1  0   4<br>-25 -4 12 14 -1  9  6   9<br>-15 -9 46  6 25 11 31 -21<br>-5  -6 -3 -7  0 25 53 -42<br>In this example, on an 8-cells-wide by 6-cells-high grid, we start at location (4, 4) highlighted in green above, where (0, 0) is the North West corner of the map. The maximum stamina that the skier has is 5 (in arbitrary units which are the same as for the E values of the map). We have 2 possible lodge sites, at locations (2, 1) and (6, 3), both highlighted in red above. The map of the land is then given as six lines in the file, with eight E values in each line, separated by spaces. The negative values are trees.</p><p>Output: The file output.txt which your program creates in the current directory should be formatted as follows:</p><p>N lines: Report the paths in the same order as the lodge sites were given in the input.txt file. Write out one line per target lodge. Each line should contain a sequence of X,Y pairs of coordinates of cells visited by the skier to travel from the starting point to the corresponding lodge for that line. Only use a single comma and no space to separate X,Y and a single space to separate successive X,Y entries. If no solution was found (lodge was unreachable by the skier from the given starting point), write a single word FAIL in the corresponding line. Our skier needs a rescue in this case.<br>For example, output.txt may contain:</p><p>4,4 3,3 2,2 2,1<br>4,4 5,3 6,3<br>Here the first line is a sequence of five X,Y locations which trace the path from the starting point (4,4) to the first settling site (1,1). Note how both the starting location and the settling site location are included in the path. The second line is a sequence of three X,Y locations which trace the path from the starting point (4,4) to the second possible settling site (6,3).</p><p>With the starting point shown in green, the lodge sites in red, and each traversed cell in between in yellow. Note how one could have thought of a perhaps shorter path: 4,4 4,3 3,2 2,1 (general lower |E| values). But this was not allowed, since once we get to position 4,3 we are blocked by the tree in 3,2.</p><p>Notes and hints<br>Please name your program “request.xxx” where ‘xxx’ is the extension for the programming language you choose (“py” for python, “cpp” for C++11, and “java” for Java).<br>Likely (but no guarantee) we will create 15 BFS, 15 UCS, and 20 A* text cases.<br>Your program will be killed after some time if it appears stuck on a given test case, to allow us to grade the whole class in a reasonable amount of time. We will make sure that the time limit for a given test case is at least 10x longer than it takes for the reference algorithm written by the TA to solve that test case correctly.<br>There is no limit on input size, number of target lodges, etc. other than specified above (32-bit integers, etc.). However, you can assume that all test cases will take [ 30 secs to run on a regular laptop.<br>If several optimal solutions exist, any of them will count as correct.<br>Actual test cases used for grading will be significantly more complex than the 3 examples shown below (e.g., that could have 500x500 maps or bigger). The examples below are mostly to make sure you can correctly parse the inputs and produce correctly formatted outputs.<br>Example 1<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>BFS<br>2 2<br>0 0<br>5<br>1<br>1 1<br>0   -10<br>-10 -20<br>the only possible correct output.txt is:</p><p>FAIL<br>Example 2<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>UCS<br>5 3<br>0 0<br>5<br>1<br>4 1<br>1 5   1  -1 -2<br>6 2   4  10  3<br>9 8 -10 -20 40<br>one possible correct output.txt is:</p><p>0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,1<br>Example 3<br>For this input.txt:</p><p>A*<br>5 4<br>0 1<br>3<br>1<br>4 3<br>20 2 1 -2 -10<br>-8 1 10 2 -20<br>9 -1 4 15  11<br>6 -5 1  1  -1<br>one possible correct output.txt is:</p><p>0,1 1,1 2,2 3,3 4,3</p>]]></content>

Feel free to explore the impact of the other options, specifically the ordering in which the colors are explored.</p><p>By default, the color that has fewer free neighbors (most constrained), is the one that is going to be considered first.</p><p>All the options can be found if you use option -h:</p><figure class="highlight jboss-cli"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$<span class="string">./flow</span> -h</span><br><span class="line">usage: flow_solver [ OPTIONS ] BOARD1.txt</span><br><span class="line">BOARD2.txt [ <span class="string">...</span> ] ]</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Display options:</span><br><span class="line">  -q, <span class="params">--quiet</span>             Reduce output</span><br><span class="line">  -d, <span class="params">--diagnostics</span>       Print diagnostics when search unsuccessful</span><br><span class="line">  -A, <span class="params">--animation</span>         Animate solution</span><br><span class="line">  -F, <span class="params">--fast</span>              Speed up animation 4x</span><br><span class="line">  -C, <span class="params">--color</span>             Force use of ANSI color</span><br><span class="line">  -S, <span class="params">--svg</span>               Output final state to SVG</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Node evaluation options:</span><br><span class="line">  -d, <span class="params">--deadends</span>          dead-end checking</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Color ordering options:</span><br><span class="line">  -r, <span class="params">--randomize</span>         Shuffle order of colors before solving</span><br><span class="line">  -c, <span class="params">--constrained</span>       Disable order by most constrained</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Search options:</span><br><span class="line">  -n, <span class="params">--max-nodes</span> N       Restrict storage to N nodes</span><br><span class="line">  -m, <span class="params">--max-storage</span> N     Restrict storage to N MB <span class="params">(default 1024)</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Help:</span><br><span class="line">  -h, <span class="params">--help</span>              See this <span class="keyword">help</span> text</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="Output"><a href="#Output" class="headerlink" title="Output"></a>Output</h4><p>Your solver will print the following information if option -q is used:</p><p>Puzzle Name<br>SearchFlag (see utils.c, line 65-68 to understand the flags)<br>Total Search Time, in seconds<br>Number of generated nodes<br>A final Summary<br>For example, the output of your solver ./flow -q ../puzzles/regular_* could be:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">../puzzles/regular_5x5_01.txt s <span class="number">0.000</span> <span class="number">18</span></span><br><span class="line">../puzzles/regular_6x6_01.txt s <span class="number">0.000</span> <span class="number">283</span></span><br><span class="line">../puzzles/regular_7x7_01.txt s <span class="number">0.002</span> <span class="number">3</span>,<span class="number">317</span></span><br><span class="line">../puzzles/regular_8x8_01.txt s <span class="number">0.284</span> <span class="number">409</span>,<span class="number">726</span></span><br><span class="line">../puzzles/regular_9x9_01.txt s <span class="number">0.417</span> <span class="number">587</span>,<span class="number">332</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">5</span> total s <span class="number">0.704</span> <span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">000</span>,<span class="number">676</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>These numbers depend on your implementation of the search, the ordering you use, and whether you prune dead-ends.

Obviously, your source code is expected to compile and execute flawlessly using the following makefile command:</p><p>Remember to compile using the optimization flag gcc -O3 for doing your experiments, it will run twice as quickly as compiling with the debugging flag gcc -g (see Makefile). The provided Makefile compiles with the optimization flag by default, and with the debugging flag if you type make debug=1. For the submission, please do not remove the -g option from your Makefile, as our scripts need this flag for testing. Your program must not be compiled under any flags that prevent it from working under gdb or valgrind.</p><p>Your implementation should be able to solve the regular puzzles provided. To solve the extreme puzzles, you’ll need further enhancements that go beyond the time for this request, but feel free to challenge yourself if you finish early and explore how you would solve the extreme puzzles.</p><h3 id="Deliverable-2-Experimentation"><a href="#Deliverable-2-Experimentation" class="headerlink" title="Deliverable 2 - Experimentation"></a>Deliverable 2 - Experimentation</h3><p>Besides handing in the solver source code, you’re required to provide a table reporting at least the execution time and number of generated nodes with and without dead-end detection. Include in the table only the puzzles that your solver finds a solution to.</p><p>Plot figures, where the x-axis can be the number of free cells at the start, or the size of the grid, and the y-axis is either the number of generated states or solution time.</p><p>Explain your results using your figures and tables. Which complexity growth does your data show? What’s the computational benefit of the dead-end detection, does it decrease the growth rate? Answer concisely.</p><p>If you decide to implement any further optimization beyond the instructions of the request, or change the default arguments such as allowed memory or color ordering, please discuss their impact on the experimentation section as well.</p><p>Please include your Username, Student ID and Full Name in your Document.</p><p>My recommendation is that you generate the plots using any standard Python visualization library. See for example Seaborn or Matplotlib. Otherwise, there’s always the old-school excel/open-office/google-sheets method.</p>]]></content>
