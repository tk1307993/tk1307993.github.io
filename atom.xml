    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h3><p>You must use the C++ I/O streaming and memory management facilities on this assignment. Moreover, the only standard headers you may #include are iostream, fstream, sstream, iomanip, string, and utility. Marmoset will be programmed to reject submissions that violate these restrictions.</p><p>Each question on this assignment asks you to write a C++ program, and the programs you write on this assignment each span multiple files. Moreover, each question asks you to submit a Makefile for building your program. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you develop your solution for each question in a separate directory. Just remember that, for each question, you should be in that directory when you create your zip file, so that your zip file does not contain any extra directory structure.</p><p>Questions on this assignment will be hand-marked to ensure that you are writing high quality code, and to ensure that your solutions employ the programming techniques mandated by each question.</p><h3 id="Position"><a href="#Position" class="headerlink" title="Position"></a>Position</h3><p>In this exercise, you will write a C++ class (implemented as a struct) to control a simple robotic drone exploring some terrain. Your drone starts at coordinates (0,0), facing north. Use the following structure definition for coordinates:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title">Position</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">int</span> ew, ns;</span><br><span class="line">  Position( <span class="keyword">int</span> ew = <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="keyword">int</span> ns = <span class="number">0</span> );</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The east-west direction is the first component of a position, and the north-south direction is the second. Your Drone class must be properly initialized via a constructor, and must provide the following methods:</p><p><table><br>    <tr><br>        <th>Method</th><br>        <th>Description</th><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td>void forward()</td><br>        <td>Move the drone one unit forward.</td><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td>void backward()</td><br>        <td>Move the drone one unit backward.</td><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td>void left()</td><br>        <td>Turns the drone 90 degrees to the left, while remaining in the same location.</td><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td>void right()</td><br>        <td>Turns the drone 90 degrees to the right, while remaining in the same location.</td><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td>Position current()</td><br>        <td>Returns the current position of the drone.</td><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td>int manhattanDistance()</td><br>        <td>Returns the total units of distance travelled by the drone.</td><br>    </tr><br></table><br>For simplicity, you may assume that the drone will never visit more than 50 positions before running out of fuel or otherwise breaking down.</p><p>Implement the specified operations for the Drone. (Some starter code has been provided for you in the file drone.h, along with a sample executable.) You may not change the contents of drone.h other than by adding your instance variables and comments i.e. the interface must stay exactly the same.</p><p>The test harness a3q1.cc is provided with which you may interact with your drone for testing purposes. The test harness is not robust and you are not to devise tests for it, just for the Drone class.

The matrix “stealing” the information must be able to grow or shrink as necessary and not throw an error.</p></li><li><p>Use the language features to simplify how you handle reading in the matrix dimensions and values. It should be possible for any white space to be used to separate the numbers (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) and have the input operator work properly. You shouldn’t need to do anything complex, so don’t over-think it.</p></li><li><p>When outputting the values of the matrix, an empty matrix produces the string “[]”. A non-empty matrix outputs each row’s values on a separate line, and sets the width of the value to 4 (see the setw operator in the iomanip library). You are not required to handle values whose width (including the sign) exceed this size.</p></li><li><p>The declaration of the Matrix type can be found in the provided Matrix.h file. For your submission you must add all requisite declarations to Matrix.h and all routine and member definitions to Matrix.cc. The public interface to Matrix may not be changed.</p></li><li><p>The provided test harness, a3q2.cc, can be compiled with your solution to test (and then debug) your code. The test harness is not robust and you are not to devise tests for it, just for the Matrix class. Do not change this file. The test harness allows you to have up to 10 matrices defined at one time, identified as m0 to m9. If a matrix has not been initialized, it consists of a nullptr. Most of the test harness commands cannot be performed upon an uninitialized matrix, and the harness enforces this. Additionally, the user prompts are printed to standard error so that they will not interfere with the output produced, and thus make it easier to write your test files. The test harness also provides some simple error checking, such as ensuring that get/set are within the bounds of the matrix,and that matrix dimensions are compatible for addition and multiplication. If the commands do not meets its criteria, they are silently ignored. Thus, you are not required to test these cases and only need to test valid input.</p></li><li><p>Your Makefile must create an executable named matrix. Note that the executable name is case-sensitive.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Learning-Outcomes"><a href="#Learning-Outcomes" class="headerlink" title="Learning Outcomes"></a>Learning Outcomes</h3><p>In this project you will demonstrate your understanding of dynamic memory and linked data structures, and extend your skills in terms of program design, testing, and debugging. You will also learn about inverted indexes, and the basic principles of web search algorithms.</p><h3 id="Indexed-Document-Retrieval"><a href="#Indexed-Document-Retrieval" class="headerlink" title="Indexed Document Retrieval"></a>Indexed Document Retrieval</h3><p>The idea of an inverted index was mentioned briefly in class. To build an index for some input text, the words are isolated, together with their document numbers (in our case, line numbers in the input file), and arranged so that, for every word, a list of the documents that contain that word is constructed. In terms of notation, if t is an indexed term, then f t is the number of documents in the collection that contain that term at least once; and for any given document d, the value f d,t is the number of times that t appears in d. For example, consider the text:<br><figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">line</span> <span class="literal">one</span> has <span class="literal">one</span> <span class="built_in">word</span> twice</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">line</span> <span class="literal">two</span> has <span class="keyword">words</span> once only</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">line</span> <span class="literal">three</span> follows <span class="keyword">lines</span> <span class="literal">one</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="literal">two</span>, but <span class="keyword">not</span> <span class="literal">four</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">line</span> <span class="literal">four</span> is like <span class="keyword">the</span> other <span class="keyword">lines</span>, <span class="keyword">not</span> like <span class="built_in">line</span> <span class="literal">five</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">line</span> <span class="literal">five</span> has <span class="built_in">word</span> <span class="literal">one</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="built_in">word</span> <span class="literal">two</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="built_in">word</span> <span class="literal">three</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="literal">six</span> is <span class="keyword">the</span> littlest <span class="literal">one</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>If each line of that input file is taken to be a “document”, then the first few lines of a simple document-level inverted index for it would be<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">and <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">but <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">five <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">follows <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">four <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">has <span class="number">3</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>where the first integer following each word is the f(t) value for that term t, with exactly that many (d, f(d,t)) pairs after it all on the same input line. For example, term t = “and” appears in f(t) = 2 documents, document d = 3 (with f(d,t) = 1, that is, one occurrence), and in document d = 5 (with f(d,t) = 2 occurrences). The full index file for the original six lines is available on the LMS, together with larger examples.

The only assumption you may make, purely for the purposes of reading the input strings, is that each term in the index will be at most 999 characters long. Apart from a single buffer of that size, all stored strings and lists of (d, f(d,t)) pairs should be held in dynamic arrays of the correct length for the data they contain (or within a factor of two of that minimum length). As evidence of the operation of this stage of your program, it should report the number of terms in the index that was read, the total number of (d, f(d,t)) pairs in the index, and up to ten of the pairs associated with the first two and the last two terms in the index, using exactly the output format that is shown here and in the LMS examples.

That is, all strings will be lower-case alpha only; all elements will be separated by a single space; all lines will have the correct number of values; all lines (including the last one) will be ended by a single (DOS-style) CR-LF combination (see the discussion of this in the Assignment 1 FAQ page); etc. Note that the terms are provided in the index file in strict dictionary order, and that the d values in the set of pairs associated with each term are also are strictly increasing; you will need to make these two facts in Stage 2 and Stage 3. Your Stage 1 program must open and read from a named file (and not from stdin yet, see Stage 2 for that input) so you will need to be familiar with Chapter 11 of the textbook. Output should be written to stdout (but you may also write error messages to stderr if you wish).</p><h3 id="Stage-2-–-Queries-and-Term-Lookup"><a href="#Stage-2-–-Queries-and-Term-Lookup" class="headerlink" title="Stage 2 – Queries and Term Lookup"></a>Stage 2 – Queries and Term Lookup</h3><p>Extend your program so that it reads “queries” from stdin and looks up their corresponding term numbers in the index. Terms that do not appear in the index should be noted accordingly. For example (not showing the Stage 1 output again):<br><figure class="highlight maxima"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mac: ./ass2-soln test0-<span class="literal">ind</span>.txt</span><br><span class="line">four <span class="keyword">and</span> five</span><br><span class="line">Stage <span class="number">2</span> Output</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"four"</span> <span class="built_in">is</span> term <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"and"</span> <span class="built_in">is</span> term <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"five"</span> <span class="built_in">is</span> term <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line">line seven</span><br><span class="line">Stage <span class="number">2</span> Output</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"line"</span> <span class="built_in">is</span> term <span class="number">9</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"seven"</span> <span class="built_in">is</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> indexed</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The eventual expectation in this stage is that you will use binary search to do this lookup; but it might be prudent to make use of linear search in the first instance, while you are debugging this stage and working on Stage 3, and then switch to binary search when you are sure of yourself, and ready to extend again. You may assume that each input line will contain at most 999 characters, and at most 20 different query terms. Lines should be processed interactively, so that the output for each line is generated before the next line is typed, with query terms limited to alphabetic characters, and case-folded to lowercase before the lookup is undertaken, to match the index. You do not need to retain each query line once it has been processed by Stage 2 and then Stage 3.</p><h3 id="Stage-3-–-Ranked-Querying"><a href="#Stage-3-–-Ranked-Querying" class="headerlink" title="Stage 3 – Ranked Querying"></a>Stage 3 – Ranked Querying</h3><p>Ok, now for the fun part. Suppose that the collection has N documents, and suppose that (as before) term t appears in f(t) of them, and appears in document d a total of f(d,t) times. To determine the documents d(here, lines) that are the “strongest” matches for each query q, the following calculation is carried out on a per-document basis.</p><p>The average document length over the N documents (computed as the arithmetic mean), and k = 1.2 and b = 0.75 are constants. Broadly speaking, there are three key relationships being balanced in this equation: rare words with low f(t) values are regarded as being more important than common words; words that appear multiple times in any given document have more weight than words that only appear a few times; and long documents are discounted relative to shorter ones. This computation is known as the “BM25” similarity mechanism. A wide range of other such scoring mechanisms have been proposed and used in web search systems. The ones actually used by Google and similar are, of course, closely-guarded commercial secrets, but still embed these same three principles. For web documents, commercial search providers also make use of features such as page title text; information from relative font-sizes being used; the anchor text that points to each page; language cues; the link relationships between pages; query click-through rates from other users; and so on.</p><p>Add further functionality to your program so that as each query is read from stdin, it is processed against the index, and the top-3 matching documents (by score, with ties on score resolved according to increasing document number) identified and reported. For example (with the interleaved Stage 2 outputs suppressed, see the LMS for full examples of the output required):<br><figure class="highlight stata"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">mac</span>: ./ass2-soln test0-ind.txt</span><br><span class="line">four and five</span><br><span class="line">Stage 3 Output</span><br><span class="line">    document   5: <span class="keyword">score</span> 3.619</span><br><span class="line">    document   3: <span class="keyword">score</span> 3.115</span><br><span class="line">    document   4: <span class="keyword">score</span> 2.978</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">line</span> seven</span><br><span class="line">Stage 3 Output</span><br><span class="line">    document   4: <span class="keyword">score</span> 0.474</span><br><span class="line">    document   1: <span class="keyword">score</span> 0.425</span><br><span class="line">    document   2: <span class="keyword">score</span> 0.425</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>For this process to be efficient, you need to combine a number of different sources of information, bringing components in as they are required. The document lengths |d| should be stored as part of your index data structure, and can be computed once the full index has been read. A value for N can similarly be determined from the input data and stored as a component of the index structure you build. But that still leaves the task of processing the term lists to generate document scores, and determining the top few (where “few” is three in this project, but is 10 for Google and Bing, for example) in an appropriate manner. Be sure to start simple, and check your computations at every step as you build towards the required output.</p><p>As an overall outline of the process to be implemented, to compute the required score(d, q) values you should: (a) create and set to zero an array of N document score accumulators; (b) iterate over the index entries for the (indexed) terms that appear in the query, and for each such term, iterate over its (d, f(d,t)) pairs, computing contributions to document scores one term at a time and adding them to the corresponding accumulator; and then (c) partially sort the array of accumulators (including their corresponding document numbers) to bring the biggest ones to the front. Note you don’t have to fully sort the score array in order to generate the required output (that is, there is an algorithmic efficiency question here for you to consider).</p><p>My program to implement all three stages is a little under 500 lines long, including detailed comments and debugging output, about 100 lines longer than the solution for Assignment 1. Start early! If you want more of a challenge, try writing (but please don’t submit) the indexing program that generated the index files. And, of course, a real system would generate a query-biased caption, or snippet, for each answer document (rather than just the document number), you might like to think about how that process gets done.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h3><p>Unix-based systems have long supported a utility program named find which, unsurprisingly, is used to find files and directories in a file-system. While the features provided by find are extensive, find is often criticised for its arcane syntax (see man find).</p><p>There is a need for an easier-to-use utility, with an easy-to-remember syntax, even if it supports far fewer of the infrequently used features.</p><h3 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" class="headerlink" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h3><p>The goal of this project is to implement a system utility, named cfind, to find file-system entries matching specific criteria. Successful completion of the project will develop your understanding of some advanced features of the C99 programming language, and your understanding of the role of a number of system-calls responsible for file and directory access and file-system attributes.</p><h3 id="Program-operation"><a href="#Program-operation" class="headerlink" title="Program operation"></a>Program operation</h3><p>cfind is invoked using the command:<br><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">prompt&gt;</span><span class="bash"> cfind  [options]  pathname  [<span class="built_in">stat</span>-expression]</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>which specifies optional command-line arguments, a single mandatory file-system pathname (either relative or absolute), and an optional single conditional expression. If invoked correctly, cfind will print the names of all files and directories at or below the provided pathname, for which the provided expression evalutes to true. The ‘starting’ pathname may be either a file or a directory.</p><p>A stat expression is a character string providing a Boolean predicate, written in a C-like syntax, that is evaluated against an individual file-system entry. The supported syntax provides arithmetic, equality and relational expressions, dates and times, and access to fields of the file-entry’s struct stat structure.</p><p>The default conditional expression is just ‘1’, which evaluates to true. Examples of stat expressions are given in the project’s clarifications.</p><p>Note that the stat expression will usually contain characters with a special meaning to the shell (such as whitespace characters, double-quotes, less-than/greater-than signs, and square-brackets) so it’s recommended that the full stat expression be provided within single-quote characters.</p><p>A library provides the stat expression-based functions. The anticipated use of the functions is to:</p><ol><li>First call the compile_stat_expression() function with the Boolean predicate to later be evaluated. If a valid expression, the function builds internal state to represent the expression, and returns an instance of the STAT_EXPRESSION datatype.</li><li>This STAT_EXPRESSION instance, a directory-entry’s filename (not its full pathname), and an instance of a struct stat structure are passed to the evaluate_stat_expression() function to determine if the attributes of the indicated file-entry match the expression.</li><li>Finally, when done, the STAT_EXPRESSION value is passed to free_stat_expression() to release allocated memory.<br>Command-line options, which appear before the mandatory pathname, indicate how the file-system should be traversed and how the output should be formatted.</li></ol><p>The project’s sample solution defines the project’s definitive operation.</p><p>The cfind utility is to support the following command-line options:<br><figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">-a</span><br><span class="line">Normally, file-entries beginning with the ‘.’ character are ignored.

The object is to move your car through a tangle of obstacles to reach the exit. Your job is to write a program to find the best way out of the traffic.</p><h3 id="Rules"><a href="#Rules" class="headerlink" title="Rules"></a>Rules</h3><p>Safari Rush Hour is played on a 7 x 7 game grid with up to 19 playing pieces (safari rover and animals). The object is to slide the safari rover through the exit gate in the playing grid frame. Each puzzle gives a configuration of animals and the safari rover. To play, you shift the animals and safari rover up, down, left, and right until the path is clear to make your escape. Note: lions, lionesses, impalas, zebras, rhinos, and elephants move only forward and reverse. The large square safari rover and the wild dogs (termite mound) may move up, down, right, and left.

In the puzzle specification, the letters stand for the playing pieces: 2x2 pieces: termite mounds (u,v) and safari rover (x); 3x1 pieces: elephant (o, q, s) and rhino (p, r); 2x1 pieces: lion (a, f), lioness (d, g, j), impala (b, h, i, k) and zebra (c, e).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>In the problems from the last homework, we did a bit of rudimentary Scrabble scoring. Your ultimate task here is to write a function that takes as input a rack - a list of letters - and returns the highest scoring word that can be made with those letters. This is the key ingredient in a computerized Scrabble game!</p><p>In this problem, you may use recursion as well as the built-in higher-order functions map, filter, and reduce. In fact, if you write a function that needs to process a long list (e.g. a dictionary) with more than a few hundred items in it, you are much better off letting map, filter, or reduce cruise through those lists since they have been optimized to work very fast.</p><p>There will be a few places here where using anonymous functions (lambda) is probably the cleanest and nicest way to do business. Use it when it’s the cleanest way to proceed.</p><p>One of the objectives of this problem is to have you think about designing a more complicated program that involves several functions. You have complete autonomy in deciding what functions to write in order to reach the ultimate goal (see more on the two required functions below). Try to think carefully about which functions you will need and try to implement those functions so that they are as simple and clean as possible. Part of your score on this problem will be based on the elegance of your overall design and individual functions.</p><p>Our solution has fewer than 9 functions, two of which we modified from our solution to Homework 1. The remaining 7 (or so) functions range from one to four lines of code per function. While you are not required to have the same number of functions and you may have a few slightly longer functions, this is intended to indicate that there is not much code that needs to be written here!</p><p>Be sure to have a comment at the top of the file with your name(s), the filename, and the date. Any function that is even a bit complicated should at least have a short comment explaining to the reader how this function works. Also, include a docstring for every function that you write.</p><p>All of your work should go into a single file named scrabble.py. Any tests and their results should go into this file, commented out of course. Make sure your file loads without producing any output. We will test your program by loading this file and testing your functions. Be sure they are properly named.</p><ol><li>Firstly, rewrite your definition of letterScore(letter, scoreList&gt; so it makes use of the built-in function filter.</li><li>Secondly, rewrite your definition of wordScore(word, scoreList) so that it makes use of the built-in map and reduce.</li><li>As an exercise in writing list comprehensions, define the following variables, using expressions made up of list comprehensions:<br>words – all of the words in the list Dictionary.<br>twoLetterWords – all of the words in the list Dictionary having exactly two letters.<br>lengths – a list of only the lengths of all words in Dictionary.</li><li>Now the main problem.<br>A bit later in this problem, we’ll give you a fairly large dictionary of English words to use. For now, we recommend that you use the following tiny dictionary during the course of testing and development. Include this line near the top of your file. Now, it’s a global variable that can be used by any of your functions in that file. Similarly, you should include the scrabble letter score list from Homework 1.</li></ol><p>Don’t try to change the values of these global variables! As we’ll see soon, that can make Python angry. However, there’s no need to change the contents of the Dictionary or the scrabble letter scores during execution of the program.</p><h3 id="The-details"><a href="#The-details" class="headerlink" title="The details"></a>The details</h3><p>Ultimately, there are two functions that we will be testing.</p><p>scoreList(Rack) takes as input a Rack which is a list of lower-case letters and returns a list of all of the words in the global Dictionary that can be made from those letters and the score for each one. Specifically, this function returns a list of lists, each of which contains a string that can be made from the Rack and its Scrabble score. Here are some examples using the tiny Dictionary above:<br><figure class="highlight prolog"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; scoreList([<span class="string">"a"</span>, <span class="string">"s"</span>, <span class="string">"m"</span>, <span class="string">"t"</span>, <span class="string">"p"</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[[<span class="string">'a'</span>, <span class="number">1</span>], [<span class="string">'am'</span>, <span class="number">4</span>], [<span class="string">'at'</span>, <span class="number">2</span>], [<span class="string">'spam'</span>, <span class="number">8</span>]]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; scoreList([<span class="string">"a"</span>, <span class="string">"s"</span>, <span class="string">"m"</span>, <span class="string">"o"</span>, <span class="string">"f"</span>, <span class="string">"o"</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[[<span class="string">'a'</span>, <span class="number">1</span>], [<span class="string">'am'</span>, <span class="number">4</span>], [<span class="string">'foo'</span>, <span class="number">6</span>]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The order in which the words are presented is not important.</p><p>bestWord(Rack) takes as input a Rack as above and returns a list with two elements: the highest possible scoring word from that Rack followed by its score. If there are ties, they can be broken arbitrarily. Here is an example, again using the tiny Dictionary above:<br><figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;</span>&gt; bestWord([<span class="string">"a"</span>, <span class="string">"s"</span>, <span class="string">"m"</span>, <span class="string">"t"</span>, <span class="string">"p"</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="string">'spam'</span>, <span class="number">8</span>]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Aside from these two functions, all of the other helper functions are up to you! Some of those helper functions may be functions that you wrote in Homework 1 or slight variants of those functions. However, you might find it useful to use a strategy in which you write a function that determines whether or not a given string can be made from the given Rack list. Then, another function can use that function to determine the list of all strings in the dictionary that can be made from the given Rack. Finally, another function might score those words.</p><p>Remember to use map, reduce, or filter where appropriate - they are powerful and they are optimized to be very fast.</p><p>Test each function carefully with small test inputs before you proceed to write the next function. This will save you a lot of time and aggravation!</p><p>A reminder about in: Imagine that you are writing a function that attempts to determine if a given string S can be made from the letters in the Rack list. You might be tempted to scramble (“permute” to use a technical term) the Rack in every possible way as part of this process, but that is more work than necessary. Instead, you can test if the first symbol in your string, S[0], appears in the rack with the statement:</p><figure class="highlight ada"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> S[<span class="number">0</span>] <span class="keyword">in</span> Rack:</span><br><span class="line">  # <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="literal">True</span> you will <span class="keyword">end</span> up here</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  # <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="literal">False</span> you will <span class="keyword">end</span> up here</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That in feature is very handy. Now, recursion will let you do the rest of the work without much effort on your part!<br>Although we don’t expect that you will end up doing huge recursive calls, you should know that Python can get snippy when there are a lot of recursive calls. By default, Python generally complains when there are 1000 or more recursive calls of the same function. To convince Python to be friendlier, you can use the following at the top of your file.</p><figure class="highlight elm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> sys</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)  # Allows up to 10000 recursive calls; the maximum permitted ranges from system to system</p><h3 id="Trying-it-with-a-bigger-dictionary"><a href="#Trying-it-with-a-bigger-dictionary" class="headerlink" title="Trying it with a bigger dictionary"></a>Trying it with a bigger dictionary</h3><p>Finally, if you want to test out a big dictionary (it’s more fun than the little one above), you can download the file. It contains a large list of words (a bit over 4000 words). The list is still called Dictionary. After you have downloaded the file and placed it in the same directory as your Python file, you should do the following at the top of your Python file:</p><figure class="highlight capnproto"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> dict <span class="keyword">import</span> *</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, you can refer to Dictionary as a global variable. This is much nicer than cutting-and-pasting that very large list into your Python file. Here are some examples using that Dictionary.</p><figure class="highlight prolog"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; scoreList([<span class="string">'w'</span>, <span class="string">'y'</span>, <span class="string">'l'</span>, <span class="string">'e'</span>, <span class="string">'l'</span>, <span class="string">'o'</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[[<span class="string">'leo'</span>, <span class="number">3</span>], [<span class="string">'low'</span>, <span class="number">6</span>], [<span class="string">'lowly'</span>, <span class="number">11</span>], [<span class="string">'ow'</span>, <span class="number">5</span>], [<span class="string">'owe'</span>, <span class="number">6</span>], [<span class="string">'owl'</span>, <span class="number">6</span>], [<span class="string">'we'</span>, <span class="number">5</span>], [<span class="string">'well'</span>, <span class="number">7</span>], [<span class="string">'woe'</span>, <span class="number">6</span>], [<span class="string">'yell'</span>, <span class="number">7</span>], [<span class="string">'yo'</span>, <span class="number">5</span>]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Notice that “yellow” is not in this dictionary. We “cropped” off words of length 6 or more to keep the dictionary from getting too large. Finally, here is an example of bestWord in action:</p><figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;</span>&gt; bestWord([<span class="string">'w'</span>, <span class="string">'y'</span>, <span class="string">'l'</span>, <span class="string">'e'</span>, <span class="string">'l'</span>, <span class="string">'o'</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="string">'lowly'</span>, <span class="number">11</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;</span>&gt; bestWord([<span class="string">"s"</span>, <span class="string">"p"</span>, <span class="string">"a"</span>, <span class="string">"m"</span>, <span class="string">"y"</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="string">'may'</span>, <span class="number">8</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;</span>&gt; bestWord([<span class="string">"s"</span>, <span class="string">"p"</span>, <span class="string">"a"</span>, <span class="string">"m"</span>, <span class="string">"y"</span>, <span class="string">"z"</span>])</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="string">'zap'</span>, <span class="number">14</span>]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And an even bigger dictionary!</p><p>Want to try this with an even bigger dictionary? We’ve got one! The bad news is that it causes IDLE to crash on some computers. However, if you are running Python without IDLE (e.g. from the Unix shell) then this dictionary should work just fine!</p><figure class="highlight armasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="symbol">from</span> <span class="keyword">bigdict </span><span class="meta">import</span> *</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The dictionary is still called Dictionary and it is available as a global variable.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="The-Concept"><a href="#The-Concept" class="headerlink" title="The Concept"></a>The Concept</h3><p>One of our goals this semester is to attain as much abstraction as possible in our data representation. To that end, we are first going to consider the concept of a “wrapper” for a basic? numeric type. The aim is to hide many of the implementation details from the user of the type. A programmer doesn’t need (or want) to know exactly what is happening when two integers or floats or complex numbers are added, multiplied, or disemboweled. They simply want the results of such actions. This assignment will have you “wrap” quaternions:<br><figure class="highlight ini"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">h</span> = a + bi + cj + dk</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Now, you may be wondering what in the world is a quaternion. You can learn much (enough) about them by using one of the links on this webpage. It is not this one</p><h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>Your abstraction will be implemented with a class, of course. And, of course, your implementation should be transparent. This means that the functionality you build into your class should reflect the expected behavior of your type and that of the C++ primitives (int, float, etc.). So, in addition to the usual functions of a well defined and physiologically appealing class, you will need to overload operators so that operations such as<br><figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">h1 += h2</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>make sense and indeed work. In addition, you want your quaternions to be able to be based in numeric types of varying kinds. That is, you want the ability to have the a’s, b’s, c’s and d’s be int or float or double or whatever. So, you will template the class.</p><p>Once you have your quaternion class, you will need to demonstrate how well it works. To do this, we want you to concurrently learn a little mathematics and to demonstrate your programming prowess by coding and applying a norm. Ok, so what is a norm? Loosely speaking, a norm is a way of measuring on a set of objects. It is a real-valued function of a set of things. The set of things you will be concerned with here is a set of quaternions. The norm you will implement is the L1 - norm (pr. “el 1 norm”) and is defined to be the sum of the “magnitudes” of the elements in that set. For a quaternion, we will define its magnitude as the square root of the sum of the squares of the component coefficients (a, b, c, d in the above example) of that quaternion. Thus, you must “pass” to your implementation of the norm a set of objects on which to operate. What, then, is the relationship between objects and operations here? This is your problem. You need to think carefully about your design. Use your UML. I passed out in class some sample code and UML to help you get your head around this idea. So you need to think about what class depends on what other class.</p><p>It is possible to implement your norm operation either as a function or as a class. However, we will require that you implement it as a class for this assignment. The concept of representing an operation as a class may be foreign to you. But the method has definite advantages. It boils down to this: define a class with no data (in this case) and one (public) overloaded operator, the function evaluation operator. Using the class object then appears to be the use of a function. I will speak about this in class.</p><p>We want you to use the STL vector class to contain your set of objects (quaternions). Then you will be able to do this and have a vector of quaternion values whose components are ints. Note: be careful to put that extra space between the two &gt; symbols if you are not compiling with c++11.</p><h3 id="Program-Specifications"><a href="#Program-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Program Specifications"></a>Program Specifications</h3><p>You will include in your submission source code for your templated quaternion class.

Prove or disprove: “For any AVL tree T and any key x in T , if we let T1 = Delete(T, x) and T2 = Insert(T1, x), then T2 = T1 .” State clearly whether you are attempting to prove or disprove the statement. If proving, give a clear general argument; if disproving, give a concrete example where you show clearly each tree T, T1, T2 with the balance factors indicated beside each node.</p><p>b. Find an AVL tree T and a key x in T such that calling Delete(T, x) causes two rebalancing operations to take place. Your tree T should be as small as possible, in terms of the number of nodes, so that this takes place (you do not have to prove that it is indeed the smallest). Show your original tree T and the key x, then show the result of each rebalancing operation. Make sure to clearly indicate the balance factor next to each node.</p><h3 id="Question-3"><a href="#Question-3" class="headerlink" title="Question 3"></a>Question 3</h3><p>Give a simple, linear-time algorithm that determines if a Binary Search Tree (BST) satisfies the AVL balancing condition. The algorithm’s input is a pointer to the root of a BST T where each node u has the following fields: an integer key, and lchild and rchild which are pointers to the left and right children of u in T (if u has no left or right child, then u.lchild = Nil or u.rchild = Nil, respectively). There is no balance factor or height information already stored in any node. The algorithm’s output is True if T satisfies the AVL balancing condition, and False otherwise.</p><p>The worst-case running time of your algorithm must be O(n) where n is the number of nodes in T.</p><p>Describe your algorithm by giving its pseudo-code, and explain why its worst-case running time is O(n).</p><h3 id="Question-4"><a href="#Question-4" class="headerlink" title="Question 4"></a>Question 4</h3><p>We want an efficient algorithm for the following problem. The algorithm is given an integer m &gt; 1, and then a (possibly infinite) sequence of distinct keys are input to the algorithm, one at a time. A query operation can occur at any point between any two key inputs in the sequence.</p><p>When a query occurs, the algorithm must return, in sorted order, the m smallest keys among all the keys that were input before the query. Assume that at least m keys are input before the first query occurs.</p><p>For example, suppose m = 3, and the key inputs and query operations occur in the following order:<br><figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="number">20</span>, <span class="number">15</span>, <span class="number">31</span>, <span class="number">6</span>, <span class="number">13</span>, <span class="number">24</span>, query, <span class="number">10</span>, <span class="number">17</span>, query, <span class="number">9</span>, <span class="number">16</span>, <span class="number">5</span>, <span class="number">11</span>, query, <span class="number">14</span>, ...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Then the first query should return 6, 13, 15; the second query should return 6, 10, 13; the third query should return 5, 6, 9.</p><p>Describe a simple algorithm that, for every m &gt; 1, solves the above problem with the following worst-case time complexity:</p><ul><li>O(log m) to process each input key, and</li><li>O(m) to perform each query operation.</li></ul>]]></content>

Assume that basefrom and baseto are integers between 2 and 25 (both inclusive). Since base 16 uses the characters A, B, C, D, E, F to represent decimal numbers 10 through 15, bases 17 through 20 will involve additional characters. For example, base 20 will involve the additional characters G, H, I and J. Use defensive programming to make sure your command line arguments are what you would expect. You may assume that no number (in any base) has more than 32 digits, and all numbers are nonnegative.</p><p>To convert a number, say (123)9, from base 9 to another base such as base 8, simply convert from base 9 to decimal (i.e., base 10), to get the number, i.e.,</p><blockquote><p>(1 x 92) + (2 x 91) + (3 x 90) = (102) 10</p></blockquote><p>and then convert to base 8 by doing repeated division, just the way you convert from decimal to binary (base 2) - simple, because you understand decimal (base 10) arithmetic. In this case you should get (146)8.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="What-you-have-to-do"><a href="#What-you-have-to-do" class="headerlink" title="What you have to do"></a>What you have to do</h3><p>You have to implement a very simple disk operating system called TinyDOS which provides the ability to store and retrieve data on a virtual drive and allows inspection of that data using cat or similar commands at any time during the execution of a program which uses the virtual drive.</p><p>The TinyDOS system creates files with full pathnames such as /dir1/dir2/file3 . The slashes represent separation into directories. The root directory is / . Each part of the pathname will be no more than 8 characters long.</p><p>There are classes you have to implement in order to get your file system working: a volume class is essential, but you probably want to have a directory entry class and possibly others. You also must write a TinyDOS program which the markers will use to pass commands to your implementation.</p><h3 id="Drive"><a href="#Drive" class="headerlink" title="Drive"></a>Drive</h3><p>The virtual drive is represented by an ordinary file on your computer. The Python code to implement the virtual drive is provided in the drive.py file (see later in the handout if you wish to use a different language). You make a drive by creating a Drive object and calling the format method. This creates the file on the real machine which represents your virtual drive. All of the data on the virtual disk should be stored as readable ASCII so that by opening the real machine file you can easily see the contents of your virtual drive.</p><p>The write_block method of the Drive class writes directly to the underlying real file. Similarly the read_block method reads from the real file. Your file system must do all of its work by writing entire blocks to the drive and reading blocks from the drive using only these functions. This is how drives work, they are block addressable devices. In this assignment a block is always 512 bytes long.</p><p>Every virtual drive contains 128 blocks (from 0 to 127).</p><p>If you run the following program which creates a drive file and then displays it using cat , you will see the structure of a virtual drive.</p><figure class="highlight gradle"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> drive</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> subprocess <span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="keyword">call</span></span><br><span class="line">vdrive = drive.Drive(<span class="string">'vdrive'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">vdrive.format()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">call</span>(<span class="string">'cat vdrive'</span>, shell=<span class="keyword">True</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Initially each block is filled in with 512 spaces. These blocks are separated by a line like:<br><figure class="highlight asciidoc"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="bullet">** </span>1 *<span class="strong">*</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>where the number is the block number of the block directly above the separator.</p><h3 id="Volume"><a href="#Volume" class="headerlink" title="Volume"></a>Volume</h3><p>A drive is represented to the operating system as a volume. Formatting a volume means putting extra information on the drive so that it can be recognised and used by the TinyDOS operating system. This is a second format. The drive format is like that performed by a drive manufacturer before shipping a drive. A volume format is like the format you can perform using your operating system.</p><p>The only access a volume has to a drive is through the methods in the Drive class.</p><p>A volume format should write the following information into block 0 of the drive. Block 0 is the volume info block.</p><p>The first 128 bytes of the block represent the bitmap of available blocks on the drive. If a block is free it is represented with the byte corresponding to ‘ - ‘. If the block is used it is ‘ + ‘.</p><p>The remaining 384 bytes of block 0 consist of 6 directory entries.</p><h3 id="Using-a-Volume"><a href="#Using-a-Volume" class="headerlink" title="Using a Volume"></a>Using a Volume</h3><p>A s you use a volume to create files you need to make modifications to the volume (which makes modifications to the drive).</p><p>To create a file you need to find an empty directory entry in the directory you are creating the file in. All directories except the root directory can grow as needed.</p><p>At first this is all a file consists of - a directory entry. When the file gets written to it must be allocated a block for data. Each block is taken from the free blocks indicated in the volume bitmap. The block number is inserted into its correct position in the 12 block numbers of the directory entry. The length of the file also needs to be updated in the directory entry and the block containing the directory entry needs to be written back to the drive, along with any other blocks which have been modified.</p><h3 id="Directory"><a href="#Directory" class="headerlink" title="Directory"></a>Directory</h3><p>A directory (apart from the one in the volume info block) is just an ordinary file with a file type of “ d: “. Like ordinary files they have a maximum number of 12 blocks of data. Each block allocated to a directory consists of 8 directory entries. When a new block is allocated to a directory you can fill in all the 8 directory entries in that block (initially each should be the same as the default directory entries in the volume info block).</p><h3 id="A-File"><a href="#A-File" class="headerlink" title="A File"></a>A File</h3><p>When a file is created it has a size of zero. As data is appended to the file, blocks are allocated to the file and the file length goes up. Writing to a file normally requires reading a block, modifying the contents of the block and writing the updated block back to the drive. It also requires modifying the directory entry for the file and writing that to the drive as well.</p><h3 id="To-test"><a href="#To-test" class="headerlink" title="To test"></a>To test</h3><p>In order to test your TinyDOS implementation you need to provide a program which takes commands from stdin (usually the keyboard) and interprets them. You should call this program TinyDOS (e.g. TinyDOS.py , or TinyDOS.java etc.) and give the marker instructions on how to start it (because you might have written it in a variety of languages) in Question 1.</p><p>The TinyDOS program quits.</p><p>All commands in a command file will be legal. However you should write your program in such a way that all incorrect situations cause an error to be reported to the user, either by printing a message on the screen or by throwing or raising an exception. These exceptions are allowed to terminate the program.</p><p>The marker will have a second terminal open when testing your program. In this terminal he/she will be able to call commands such as cat to display the contents of the file which contains your drive information. This way the marker should see the effects of the commands modifying the underlying file. The reason for this is that it is possible to perform many of the commands in memory without using read_block or write_block and the assignment is to get you to implement a file system only with read_block and write_block.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h3><p>A markup language is a language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate the text. Most markup languages are human readable because the annotations are written in a way to distinguish them from the text. The most important feature of a markup language is that the tags it uses to indicate annotations should be easy to distinguish from the document content.</p><p>One of the most well-known markup languages is the one commonly used to create web pages, called HTML, or “Hypertext Markup Language”. In HTML, tags appear in “angle brackets”. When you load a Web page in your browser, you do not see the tags themselves: the browser interprets the tags as instructions on how to format the text for display.</p><p>Most tags in HTML are used in pairs to indicate where an effect starts and ends. For example:<br><figure class="highlight applescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;p&gt;</span><br><span class="line">this <span class="keyword">is</span> a <span class="built_in">paragraph</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> <span class="built_in">text</span> written <span class="keyword">in</span> HTML</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/p&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Here tag p represents the start of a paragraph, and tap p indicates where that paragraph ends.</p><p>Other tags include tag b that are used to place the enclosed text in bold font, and tag i indicate that the enclosed text is italic.<br>Note that “end” tags look just like the “start” tags, except for the addition of a backslash ‘/‘ after the symbol.</p><p>Sets of tags are often nested inside other sets of tags. For example, an ordered list is a list of numbered bullets.</p><p>You specify the start of an ordered list with the tag ol, and the end with /ol. Within the ordered list, you identify items to be numbered with the tags li (for “list item”) and /li. For example, the following specification:<br><figure class="highlight xml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">ol</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span>First item<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span>Second item<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span>Third item<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">ol</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>would result in the following:</p><ol><li>First item</li><li>Second item</li><li>Third item</li></ol><p>Notice how you start the ordered list with the ol tag, specify three line items with matching li and /li tags, and the close the ordered list with the /ol tag.</p><p>You may have noticed that the pattern of using matching tags strongly resembles the pattern of matching parentheses that we discussed in class: when you use parentheses, brackets, and braces, they have to match in reverse order, such as “{[()]}”. A pattern such as “[(])” would be incorrect since the right bracket does not match the left parenthesis. Similarly, an HTML pattern such as ol li /ol /li would be incorrect since the closing tags are in the wrong order.</p><p>The aim of this question is to write an “HTML Checker” program that takes as input an HTML file, and produces a report indicating whether or not the tags are correctly matched.</p><p>Just as the parenthesis checker uses a stack to store symbols waiting for a match to be found, your program should also use a stack. You should include the implementation of the Stack ADT discussed in class.</p><p>Input: As input for your program, the sample test files (test1.html, test2.html, test3.html, test4.html, test5.html) can be download from the course website. You can open the test files with a text editor i.e. Notepad++. The test files are created with different scenarios both test1.html and test2.html have balanced tags, whereas the rest of the test files have unbalanced tag.</p><h3 id="Processing-the-input-file"><a href="#Processing-the-input-file" class="headerlink" title="Processing the input file"></a>Processing the input file</h3><p>The first task your program must do is read in an HTML file and extract the tags. A simple strategy for doing this would be to write a function “getTags” that:</p><ul><li>reads one character at a time from the data file, throwing everything away until it gets to a “&lt;”. (Discard the “&lt;” as well.)</li><li>reads one character at a time, appending it to a string, until it gets to a “&gt;” or whitespace. (Discard the “&gt;” as well.)<br>append the tag to a list.</li><li>returns tags found.</li></ul><p>Make sure you account for end-of-file conditions in getTags. If you have completed everything correctly, you now have a list of tags, both start and end tags, once the getTags function is invoked.</p><h3 id="HTML-Tag-Checker"><a href="#HTML-Tag-Checker" class="headerlink" title="HTML Tag Checker"></a>HTML Tag Checker</h3><p>Write a function called “checkTags” that iterates through your list of tags, looking for matches.</p><ul><li>If there is a mismatch of beginning and ending tags, print an error message (see output section below) and terminate.</li><li>After processing the list of tags and there is no mismatch, print a confirmation message (see output section below).</li><li>At the end of the list, there are remaining tags on the stack, print a confirmation message (see output section below) and the remaining tags in the stack.</li></ul><p>In addition, have your program build a list called “VALIDTAGS”. As you iterate through your list of tags, check to see if the tag appears in VALIDTAGS. If it doesn’t, add it to VALIDTAGS and print a confirmation message (see output section below).</p><h3 id="Output"><a href="#Output" class="headerlink" title="Output"></a>Output</h3><p>The output of your program should include the following:</p><ul><li>A printout of your list of tags (the result of getTags).</li><li>One line for each tag as you process it, explaining the action and showing the current contents of the stack. You may have to modify your ADT to allow for the information to be displayed properly. Some examples are:<figure class="highlight stylus"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Tag <span class="selector-tag">b</span> pushed: stack is now [<span class="selector-tag">html</span>, <span class="selector-tag">body</span>, b]</span><br><span class="line">Tag /<span class="selector-tag">b</span> matches <span class="attribute">top</span> of stack: stack is now [html, body]</span><br><span class="line">Tag <span class="selector-tag">ul</span> pushed: stack is now [<span class="selector-tag">html</span>, <span class="selector-tag">body</span>, ul]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li></ul><p>A message every time you add a tag to VALIDTAGS. For example:</p><ul><li>New tag XXX found and added to list of valid tags</li></ul><h3 id="The-Twist"><a href="#The-Twist" class="headerlink" title="The Twist"></a>The Twist</h3><p>There are some tags that do not need matching start and end tags! One example is br. This tag is used to indicate a line break at the current location. Another is meta, which is used to provide special information (“metadata”) about a webpage, and one more (left for you to identify in your data files).</p><p>If you followed the instructions above correctly, your HTML checker will notice that there are three tags that don’t have a match. Teach your program that this is okay for these three cases by maintaining a list called EXCEPTIONS which you hard-code into your main program. They will appear in your list of tags just as any other tags. However, when you begin your iteration through the list and you encounter one of these, you do not need to push it on the stack since you won’t be waiting for a close tag. Instead, just print an output line such as:<br><figure class="highlight lasso"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">Tag</span> br does <span class="literal">not</span> need <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">match</span>: <span class="built_in">stack</span> is still <span class="meta">[</span>html, body, b<span class="meta">]</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>and continue.</p>]]></content>

The times in this program use a 24 hour clock, e.g., 15:23:15 is 23 minutes and 15 seconds past 3pm. You can assume that the end time is always later than the start time. The first two lines of your program initialise the variables in the following way (you will need to change the values assigned to these two variables when you test your program):<br><figure class="highlight ini"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">start</span> = <span class="string">"06:55:55"</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">end</span> = <span class="string">"07:04:57"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The time elapsed should always be a time between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59. The start time, the end time and time elapsed always have the form “hh:mm:ss”, i.e., a single digit hour, minute or second has a “0” in front of it. Below are four example outputs from the completed program (using different variable values).<br>Your program must give the correct output in the same format as the outputs in the example below:<br><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="selector-tag">Start</span> <span class="selector-tag">time</span>: 15<span class="selector-pseudo">:26</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:12</span>  <span class="selector-tag">End</span> <span class="selector-tag">time</span>: 21<span class="selector-pseudo">:40</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:36</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="selector-tag">Total</span> <span class="selector-tag">time</span> <span class="selector-tag">elapsed</span>: 06<span class="selector-pseudo">:14</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:24</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Include this exercise in a module (file) named ‘YourUPIA1Q1.py’, e.g., afer023A1Q1.py.</p><h3 id="QUESTION-2"><a href="#QUESTION-2" class="headerlink" title="QUESTION 2"></a>QUESTION 2</h3><p>Write a program which simulates four transactions on a bank account. Initially the bank account has a balance of $11568. Each transaction is either a negative amount (a withdrawal) or a positive amount (a deposit). The amount of each transaction (withdrawal or deposit) is a random integer between 100 and 150 inclusive. Below is the statement which initialises the variable, balance:</p><p>balance = 11568<br>In the output, the amount of each transaction is displayed inside parentheses following the balance (after the transaction has been applied). The final line of output shows the overall sum of the four transactions.</p><blockquote><p>Hint: in order to create a transaction which is either a withdrawal or a deposit you will find it useful to generate a random number which is either -1 or 1. The random transaction amount is then multiplied by this number.</p></blockquote><p>Below are two example outputs using the completed program.

The program uses the following encryption method. First the 25 letter message is broken up into five 5 letter words, i.e., a five by five square of letters. Then the message is recreated by going down the five by five square of letters from left to right. For example, the message “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy” is reshaped into five rows:<br><figure class="highlight ebnf"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">abcde</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">fghij</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">klmno</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">pqrst</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">uvwxy</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>and then the message is reconstructed going down each column starting from the first column to the last column: “afkpubglqvchmrwdinsxejoty”<br>Below is the three example outputs using the completed program (using three different starting messages).<br>Your program must give the output in the same format as the outputs in the three examples below.<br><figure class="highlight delphi"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Origial <span class="keyword">message</span>: E l ntbidjhraaoiinyyslt!</span><br><span class="line">Encrypted <span class="keyword">message</span>: Enjoy this brilliant day!</span><br><span class="line">Original <span class="keyword">message</span>: Meet at <span class="number">11</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> the <span class="keyword">library</span></span><br><span class="line">Encrypted <span class="keyword">message</span>: Ma hbetiere n at1 lr <span class="number">1</span>tiy</span><br><span class="line">Original <span class="keyword">message</span>: Ma hbetiere n at1 lr <span class="number">1</span>tiy</span><br><span class="line">Encrypted <span class="keyword">message</span>: Meet at <span class="number">11</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> the <span class="keyword">library</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Include this exercise in a module (file), named ‘YourUPIA1Q4.py’, e.g., afer023A1Q4.py.</p><h3 id="QUESTION-5"><a href="#QUESTION-5" class="headerlink" title="QUESTION 5"></a>QUESTION 5</h3><p>Write a program which creates a word chain.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>For this assignment, you will be writing code that supports a simple Pokemon finding game. The basic idea of the application is that you explore multiple levels in search for Pokemon, which are then registered in your Dex. Rather than using functions, like assignment 1, you will be using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Further, you will be using the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. Your task is to write the Model. The View and Controller are provided, along with support code.</p><p>As is typical with projects where more than one person is responsible for writing code, there needs to be a way of describing how the various components interact. This is achieved by defining an Application Programming Interface (API). For this assignment, you must implement your classes according to the API that has been specified, which will ensure that your code will interact properly with the supplied View/Controller code.</p><p>One benefit to adhering to MVC is that the model can be developed and tested independently of the view or controller. It is recommended that you follow this approach. This means testing your model iteratively as you develop your code.</p><h3 id="Assignment-Tasks"><a href="#Assignment-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Assignment Tasks"></a>Assignment Tasks</h3><h4 id="Download-files"><a href="#Download-files" class="headerlink" title="Download files"></a>Download files</h4><p>The first task is to download a2.py and a2_files.zip. The file a2.py is for your assignment. Do not modify the assignment file outside the area provided for you to write your code.</p><h4 id="Important-Definitions"><a href="#Important-Definitions" class="headerlink" title="Important Definitions"></a>Important Definitions</h4><p>While Pokemon is an irregular plural (meaning that its plural takes the same form as its singular, like sheep and fish), for the purposes of this assignment, multiple Pokemon are referred to as Pokemons for clarity.</p><h4 id="Positions-amp-Coordinates"><a href="#Positions-amp-Coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Positions &amp; Coordinates"></a>Positions &amp; Coordinates</h4><p>A position is represented by a (row, column) pair of numbers.<br>A cell position is a position where the row and column are both integers. It represents the position of where an object in the game could be located.<br>A wall position is a position where either the row or column value is a float ending in .5 and the other is an integer. The .5 represents that the wall is located at a boundary betweeen two cell positions for that row or column.</p><h4 id="Expecting-Registering-amp-Catching"><a href="#Expecting-Registering-amp-Catching" class="headerlink" title="Expecting, Registering, &amp; Catching"></a>Expecting, Registering, &amp; Catching</h4><p>Catching a Pokemon refers to the player adding it to their collection. Whilst moving around the game world, the player catches a Pokemon by moving onto a cell in which that Pokemon exists. When a Pokemon is caught, it is removed from the game world.<br>A Pokedex, henceforth abbreviated as Dex, maintains a registry of Pokemon that the player is expected to catch. A Pokemon is registered in a Dex when the player catches that Pokemon. Registering a Pokemon that has already been registered has no effect.</p><h4 id="Game-Data"><a href="#Game-Data" class="headerlink" title="Game Data"></a>Game Data</h4><p>Game data can be loaded using either load\game_file(file) or load_game_url(url) from the support file. These functions will raise errors if the file/url do not exist or provide invalid JSON, as specified in their docstring comments.

You will create a class called <code>SpellChecker</code> in the file <code>SpellChecker.java</code> that implements the interface <code>SpellCheckerInterface.java</code>.  The object will try to check for spelling errors in an input file, referencing a provided dictionary file. The <code>SpellChecker</code> object must accept the filename of the dictionary in its constructor. There is a sample dictionary file in the Codio workspace called <code>words.txt</code>.</p><p>The constructor of the object must (itself or by calling other methods) parse the dictionary file, storing the words in a <code>HashSet</code> instance. The <code>SpellChecker</code> object will use this dictionary as a reference when checking for spelling errors in a specified input file. Please note that <strong>every word added to the <code>HashSet</code> instance must be in lower case</strong>. In addition to the constructor, you must implement two methods to complete the functionality of your <code>SpellChecker</code> object.</p><ul><li><code>public List&lt;String&gt; getIncorrectWords(String filename)</code> - This method should return a list of all words in the input file that are incorrectly spelled according to the dictionary file provided to the constructor. The String <code>filename</code> contains the name of the file to be spell-checked.</li></ul><p>We define a word as a sequence of characters with whitespace (one or more spaces and/or tabs) on either side. To check for incorrectly spelled words, you must first read the file and process it into words. Note, however, that your program must <strong>convert the file to lowercase and remove all punctuation</strong> in generating its list of words. This means that the line <code>hey!! it&#39;s nice to see you--how are you?</code> should become <code>hey, its, nice, to, see, youhow, are, you</code>. No other input processing is necessary and there are no exceptions to these rules. Punctuation is defined as any character that is not an upper or lower case alphabet, or a number (0-9). Once you split the line into words by splitting by whitespace, remove all punctuation from every word (and don’t forget to lower case each word as well).</p><p>Your output list must contain the incorrect words that remain after processing input data (e.g. <code>youhow</code> in the above example).</p><ul><li><code>public Set&lt;String&gt; getSuggestions(String word)</code> - This method should return a set of all potential suggestions for the incorrectly spelled word that is provided as input.</li></ul><p>In order to generate a suggestion for a given word, implement the following spell checking techniques, where a character is defined as one of <code>a, b, c, ..., z</code>:</p><ul><li>Add one character - add a character at every point in the string (including at the very beginning and end)</li><li>Remove one character - remove one character at a time from each position in the string</li><li>Swap adjacent characters - swap every pair of adjacent characters in the string</li></ul><p>Your method should return all possible suggestions from each one of the techniques above. Note that the use of a <code>Set</code> object maintains only unique suggestions (i.e. no duplicates).</p><p>You may choose to write a tester file, which might print out each incorrectly spelled word in an input file and its suggestions. Any tester you write will, as usual, not be graded. This is an optional step to encourage you to ensure that your code is indeed functional and correct.</p><p>We have provided you a sample test file to spell-check. This file is called <code>test.txt</code>.</p><h2 id="Problem-2-K-Best-Values-30-points"><a href="#Problem-2-K-Best-Values-30-points" class="headerlink" title="Problem 2 - K-Best Values - 30 points"></a>Problem 2 - K-Best Values - 30 points</h2><p>Find the k-best (i.e. largest) values in a set of data. Assume you are given a sequence of values, one value at a time. We do not know how many elements there are in this sequence. In fact, there could be infinitely many. Implement the class<br><code>KBestCounter&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; implements KBest&lt;T&gt;</code> that keeps track of the k-largest elements seen so far in a sequence of data. The class should have two methods:</p><ul><li><p><code>public void count(T x)</code> - process the next element in the set of data. This operation must run in at worst <code>O(log k)</code> time.</p></li><li><p><code>public List&lt;T&gt; kbest()</code> - return a sorted (smallest to largest) list of the k-largest elements. This must run in at worst <code>O(k log k)</code> time. The method must not clobber the state of your class. This means that if you run this method twice in a row, it should return the same values.</p></li></ul><p>Your <code>KBestCounter.java</code> class must implement the provided interface <code>KBest.java</code>.</p><p>Use a priority queue to implement this functionality. We suggest using the built-in <code>java.util.PriorityQueue</code>.</p><p>As always, feel free to implement your own tester file to ensure proper functionality.</p>]]></content>
